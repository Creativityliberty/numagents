FILE: cookbook/data/PaulGrahamEssaysLarge/addiction.txt
================================================
July 2010What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is
that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.
Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.  And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.We wouldn't want to stop it.  It's the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress.  Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want is
something we want to want, we consider technological progress good.
If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that
seems strictly better.  When progress concentrates something we
don't want to want—when it transforms opium into heroin—it seems
bad.  But it's the same process at work.
[1]No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing
numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like
too much.
[2]As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.
The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive." That usage has
become increasingly common during my lifetime.  And it's clear why:
there are an increasing number of things we need it for.  At the
extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth.  Food has been
transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in
food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the
buck, and you can see the results in any town in America.  Checkers
and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.
TV has become much more engaging, and even so it can't compete with Facebook.The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.   And unless
the forms of technological progress that produced these things are
subject to different laws than technological progress in general,
the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did
in the last 40.The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  I don't
mean to imply they're all to be avoided.  Alcohol is a dangerous
drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.
Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.
More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful
about.Most people won't, unfortunately.  Which means that as the world
becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a
normal life will be driven ever further apart.  One sense of "normal"
is statistically normal: what everyone else does.  The other is the
sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a
piece of machinery: what works best.These two senses are already quite far apart.  Already someone
trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of
the US.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.
You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if
people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.
I've seen that happen with cigarettes.  When cigarettes first
appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through
a previously isolated population.  Smoking rapidly became a
(statistically) normal thing.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  We
had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of
my parents smoked.  You had to for guests.As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.
In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something
that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something
movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of
addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  A lot of the
change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation
couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed.It took a while though—on the order of 100 years.  And unless the
rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the
accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new
addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to
protect us.
[3]
Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine
of each new addiction—the people whose sad example becomes a
lesson to future generations—we'll have to figure out for ourselves
what to avoid and how.  It will actually become a reasonable strategy
(or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect 
everything new.In fact, even that won't be enough.  We'll have to worry not just
about new things, but also about existing things becoming more
addictive.  That's what bit me.  I've avoided most addictions, but
the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using
it.
[4]Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  We're
all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.
That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I
want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.
[5]
My latest trick is taking long hikes.  I used to think running was a
better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.  Now
the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I
spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it?  It always will when you're
trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide
you.  Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric.
But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this
kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate
of anyone who wants to get things done.  We'll increasingly be
defined by what we say no to.
Notes[1]
Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you
wanted it?  Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.
And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects.
"Good" and "bad" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated,
so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the
former.  And in any case, as Prohibition and the "war on drugs"
show, bans often do more harm than good.[2]
Technology has always been accelerating.  By Paleolithic
standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic
period.[3]
Unless we mass produce social customs.  I suspect the recent
resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction
to drugs.  In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if
their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to God.  But
that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to
say no to drugs.  You end up saying no to 
science as well.
I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people
plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books
a package tour.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the
government.[4]
People commonly use the word "procrastination" to describe
what they do on the Internet.  It seems to me too mild to describe
what's happening as merely not-doing-work.  We don't call it
procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.[5]
Several people have told me they like the iPad because it
lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would
be too conspicuous.  In other words, it's a hip flask.  (This is
true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as
obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.)Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and
Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.

================================================
October 2015When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or
9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.
Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die?The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.
Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive
or default dead.If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy
calculator you can use to find out.The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive
or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the
answer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious
new things they could do.  If it's default dead, we probably need
to talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends
badly.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default
dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.
It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than
it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support
himself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from
meaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people
by surprise.I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too
late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too
early.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches
polarity.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying
too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to
start worrying too late.The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the
fatal pinch.
The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough
time to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that's where they're headed.There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're
default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise
more money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the
more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking
of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.
Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save
us." Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your
head that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently
early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors
saving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of
growth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you
can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not
profitable.
[1]
But investors are so fickle that you can never
do more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about your
business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no
matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising
as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you
should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to
survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll 
have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the
sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice there
is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends
and how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually
because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big
need straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because
the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because
they're wasteful.If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just
how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.
That one is easy: don't hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by far
the biggest killer of startups that raise money.
[2]Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  But
most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than
underestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to
do.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough
people, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups have
lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order
to be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups
are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  And
partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to
face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing
enough.Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to
overhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies are
optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.
VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.
But as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above all
to survive.
[3]Here's a common way startups die.  They make something moderately
appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first
round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea
sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately
appealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convince
themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.
Their investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderately
appealing) the growth never comes.  Now they're rapidly running out
of runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But because
they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing
to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:
that the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people is
rarely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.
At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be
"built out," and that's usually easier with fewer people.
[4]Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you
from this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the
forces that push you to overhire.  Instead you'll be compelled to
seek growth in other ways. For example, by doing
things that don't scale, or by redesigning the product in the
way only founders can.
And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be
the ones that actually work.Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y Combinator
before they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founders
were terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb
into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.Notes[1]
Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  Revenue
will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth
predicts x% revenue growth.  But in practice investors discount
merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a
higher growth rate to impress investors.[2]
Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too
fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean you should
avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than
that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3]
I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders
to overhire is not even in their own interest.  They don't know how
many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have
done well if they'd survived.  My guess is a significant number.[4]
After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  I think
it's roughly correct to say that YC's most successful companies
have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great
founder is being able to resist this urge."Paul Buchheit adds:"A related problem that I see a lot is premature scaling—founders
take a small business that isn't really working (bad unit economics,
typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth
numbers. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business
much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really
fast."

Y Combinator.




November 2009I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken.  Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters
that it's broken.The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they've ever done. 
Their reputation with programmers used to be great.
It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.
The App Store has changed that.  Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil.How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that's just so far.
The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.* * *How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem is
that they don't understand software.They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly.  But this model doesn't work for software.  It doesn't
work for an intermediary to own the user.  The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words "software" and "publisher" fit together,
the underlying concepts don't.  Software isn't like music or books.
It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user.   And yet that's what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher.  And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style.If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones.  But Apple doesn't
understand that either.  Their model of product development derives
from hardware.  They work on something till they think it's finished,
then they release it.  You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.
The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate.  Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version.Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store.  They would say
that.  But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology.  Programmers don't use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.  They use it because it
yields the best results.  By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in
OS X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had
to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month
and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like?By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what
they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App
Store tends to be an old and buggy one.  One developer told me:

  As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked
  applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release
  to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.
  I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is
  "I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store", and it's
  combined with the emotion "Really, it's Apple's fault."

Another wrote:

  I believe that they think their approval process helps users by
  ensuring quality.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the
  time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,
  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.
  Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms
  that have immediate approval processes.

Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the
complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.
They must hear developers complaining.  But partners and suppliers
are always complaining.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't;
it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Meanwhile the iPhone
is selling better than ever.  So why do they need to fix anything?They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because
they make such great hardware.  I just bought a new 27" iMac a
couple days ago.  It's fabulous.  The screen's too shiny, and the
disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't
make yourself care.So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.
I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a
bad human rights record.  That was new.  In the past when I bought
things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.  Oh boy!  They make
such great stuff.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  They
make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.  Do I really want
to support this company?* * *Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.  If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side.  But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was the
people they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google and
Apple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.
And it's largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?  Partly
because they can afford to be.  The best programmers can work
wherever they want.  They don't have to work for a company they
have qualms about.But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity.  An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  And it's
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren't the ones that win.  I think the reason Google embraced "Don't
be evil" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.
[1]That has worked for Google so far.  They've become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles. With Apple that seems less the case.  When you
look at the famous 
1984 ad 
now, it's easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.
[2]
In fact, if you read the dictator's speech it sounds uncannily like a
prophecy of the App Store.

  We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
  pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
  of contradictory and confusing truths.

The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them
is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.  If
anyone should know this, Apple should.  VisiCalc made the Apple II.And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.  Most
applications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects.
Apple itself did.  Apple made microcomputers because that's what
Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  He couldn't have afforded a
minicomputer. 
[3]
 Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters
for little microcomputers because
Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  It's a
rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers
have iPhones.  They may know, because they read it in an article,
that Blackberry has such and such market share.  But in practice
it's as if RIM didn't exist. If they're going to build something,
they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building
an iPhone app.So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple
continues to maltreat them.  They're like someone stuck in an abusive
relationship.  They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't
leave.  But they're looking for a way out.  One wrote:

  While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they
  place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop
  applications as I would like. In fact I don't intend to make any
  more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.
[4]

Can anything break this cycle?  No device I've seen so far could.
Palm and RIM haven't a hope.  The only credible contender is Android.
But Android is an orphan; Google doesn't really care about it, not
the way Apple cares about the iPhone.  Apple cares about the iPhone
the way Google cares about search.* * *Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?  It's
a worrying prospect.  It would be a bummer to have another grim
monoculture like we had in the 1990s.  In 1995, writing software
for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows
applications.  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest
thing that drove us to start building web apps.At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.
You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.  If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop
apps for that instead.How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?
It's unlikely you could make something better designed.  Apple
leaves no room there.  So this alternative device probably couldn't
win on general appeal.  It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically.One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch.That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds
as development machines—if handhelds displaced laptops the
way laptops displaced desktops.  You need more control of a development
machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.Could anyone make a device that you'd carry around in your pocket
like a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?
It's hard to imagine what it would look like.  But I've learned
never to say never about technology.  A phone-sized device that
would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present
standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards
of 1995.My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with
an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when
traveling.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.
That still wouldn't be small enough to carry around everywhere like
a phone, but we're within a factor of 4 or so.  Surely that gap is
bridgeable.  In fact, let's make it an
RFS. Wanted: 
Woman with hammer.Notes[1]
When Google adopted "Don't be evil," they were still so small
that no one would have expected them to be, yet.
[2]
The dictator in the 1984 ad isn't Microsoft, incidentally;
it's IBM.  IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days, but
they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now.[3]
He couldn't even afford a monitor.  That's why the Apple
I used a TV as a monitor.[4]
Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the

Y Combinator.




April 2001, rev. April 2003(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz
Developer Symposium.)
In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I
started a startup called 
Viaweb.  
Our plan was to write
software that would let end users build online stores.
What was novel about this software, at the time, was
that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages
as the interface.A lot of people could have been having this idea at the
same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was
the first Web-based application.  It seemed such
a novel idea to us that we named the company after it:
Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,
instead of running on your desktop computer.Another unusual thing about this software was that it
was written primarily in a programming language called
Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user
applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then
had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called "How to Become a Hacker,"
and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what
languages they should learn.  He suggests starting with Python and
Java, because they are easy to learn.  The serious hacker will also
want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system
administration and cgi scripts.  Finally, the truly serious hacker
should consider learning Lisp:

  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  It
won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but
it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages
you do want to use, like English.But wait a minute.  This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.  The
reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.  If you
write in Latin, no one can understand you.  But Lisp is a computer
language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,
tell them to.So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't
you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would
make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to
use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he? I'm not trying to make
fun of Eric Raymond here.  On the whole, his advice is good.  What
he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  But
there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will
make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If Lisp
really does yield better programs, you should use it.  And if it
doesn't, then who needs it?This is not just a theoretical question.  Software is a very
competitive business, prone to natural monopolies.  A company that
gets software written faster and better will, all other things
being equal, put its competitors out of business.  And when you're
starting a startup, you feel this very keenly.  Startups tend to
be an all or nothing proposition.  You either get rich, or you get
nothing.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your
competitors will crush you.Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason
not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  We knew that everyone
else was writing their software in C++ or Perl.  But we also knew
that that didn't mean anything.  If you chose technology that way,
you'd be running Windows.  When you choose technology, you have to
ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will
work the best.This is especially true in a startup.  In a big company, you can
do what all the other big companies are doing.  But a startup can't
do what all the other startups do.  I don't think a lot of people
realize this, even in startups.The average big company grows at about ten percent a year.  So if
you're running a big company and you do everything the way the
average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the
average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course.
If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should
expect average performance.  The problem here is, average performance
means that you'll go out of business.  The survival rate for startups
is way less than fifty percent.  So if you're running a startup,
you had better be doing something odd.  If not, you're in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors
understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing
software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use
any language you want.  When you're writing desktop software,
there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same
language as the operating system.  Ten years ago, writing applications
meant writing applications in C.  But with Web-based software,
especially when you have the source code of both the language and
the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Now that you
can use any language, you have to think about which one to use.
Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that
their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.
For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be
important in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, so
a company that could get new features done before its competitors
would have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good language
for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify
the effect of rapid development, because you can release software
the minute it's done.If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better.
It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help
we could get.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in
business.  We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring
people, or raising money, or getting customers.  Neither of us had
ever even had what you would call a real job.  The only thing we
were good at was writing software.  We hoped that would save us.
Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would
take.So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.  Our hypothesis
was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get
features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things
in our software that they couldn't do.  And because Lisp was so
high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs
would be lower.  If this were so, we could offer a better product
for less money, and still make a profit.  We would end up getting
all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually
go out of business.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly,
it worked.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of
twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete
with ours.  We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the
server and yet felt like a desktop application.  Our competitors
had cgi scripts.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.
Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce
features that we didn't have.  But with Lisp our development cycle
was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within
a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  By
the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling
us, we would have the new feature too.It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of
secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or
something.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler
than they realized.  No one was leaking news of their features to
us.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone
thought possible.When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day
of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth.  The main character is an
assassin who is hired to kill the president of France.  The assassin
has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks
the president's route.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an
old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.Our secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weird
AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For years
it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now it
worked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuable
than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand.  In
business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything
publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  We never
mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web
site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio.  This
was no accident.  A startup should give its competitors as little
information as possible.  If they didn't know what language our
software was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that
way.[2]The people who understood our technology best were the customers.
They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but
they noticed that it worked really well.  It let them build great
looking online stores literally in minutes.  And so, by word of
mouth mostly, we got more and more users.  By the end of 1996 we
had about 70 stores online.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Six
months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  Today, as
Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.  It's
one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built
with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.  I left Yahoo in
1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but
the last I heard there were about 20,000.
The Blub ParadoxWhat's so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't
everyone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually
they have straightforward answers.  Lisp is so great not because
of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is
simply the most powerful language available.  And the reason everyone
doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely
technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes
slower.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.I'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming
languages vary in power.Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more
powerful than machine language.  Most programmers today would agree
that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.
Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a
compiler translate it into machine language for you.  This idea is
even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets
have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand
in machine language.  What's less often understood is that there
is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of
several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake
to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]There are many exceptions to this rule.  If you're writing a program
that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain
language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the
same language.  If you're writing a program that only has to do
something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,
you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it
may be slightly faster.  And if you're writing a short, throwaway
program, you may be better off just using whatever language has
the best library functions for the task.  But in general, for
application software, you want to be using the most powerful
(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything
else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a
lesser degree, as programming in machine language.You can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at least
as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all
treated as equivalent.  They're not.  Technically the term "high-level
language" doesn't mean anything very definite.  There's no dividing
line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level
languages on the other.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of
abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine
languages, which themselves vary in power.Consider Cobol.  Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that
it gets compiled into machine language.  Would anyone seriously
argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It's
probably closer to machine language than Python.Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures
got added to the language.  Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl
5 is more powerful than Perl 4.  But once you've admitted that,
you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful
than another.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special
cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  After a
certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.
Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider
just good enough.Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I
don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm
going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  Blub falls right
in the middle of the abstractness continuum.  It is not the most
powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine
language.And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either
of them.  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language.  That's
what compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how
anyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn't even have x (Blub
feature of your choice).As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the
power continuum, he knows he's looking down.  Languages less powerful
than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some
feature he's used to.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer
looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't
realize he's looking up.  What he sees are merely weird languages.
He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but
with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  Blub is good
enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of
the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that
he in turn looks down upon Blub.  How can you get anything done in
Blub? It doesn't even have y.By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the
differences in power between the various languages are those who
understand the most powerful one.  (This is probably what Eric
Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can't
trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:
they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because
it dictates the way they think about programs.I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing
programs in Basic.  That language didn't even support recursion.
It's hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but
I didn't miss it at the time.  I thought in Basic.  And I was a
whiz at it.  Master of all I surveyed.The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at
various points on the power continuum.  Where they fall relative
to one another is a sensitive topic.  What I will say is that I
think Lisp is at the top.  And to support this claim I'll tell you
about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other
four languages.  How can you get anything done in them, I think,
without macros? [5]Many languages have something called a macro.  But Lisp macros are
unique.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to the
parentheses.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses
in the language just to be different.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp
code looks weird.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.
They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between
Lisp and other languages.Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.  And not in the trivial
sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are
one of the data types supported by the language.  Lisp code, after
it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can
traverse.If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is
not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no
syntax.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated
within the compiler when other languages are parsed.  But these
parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can write
programs that manipulate them.  In Lisp, these programs are called
macros.  They are programs that write programs.Programs that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that?
Not very often, if you think in Cobol.  All the time, if you think
in Lisp.  It would be convenient here if I could give an example
of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did,
it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn't know Lisp;
there isn't room here to explain everything you'd need to know to
understand what it meant.  In 
Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move
things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to macros
until page 160.But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.
The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%
macros.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,
and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not
necessary.  So every macro in that code is there because it has to
be.  What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this
program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other
language.  However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my
claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him
curious.  We weren't writing this code for our own amusement.  We
were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to
put technical barriers between us and our competitors.A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some
correlation here.  A big chunk of our code was doing things that
are very hard to do in other languages.  The resulting software
did things our competitors' software couldn't do.  Maybe there was
some kind of connection.  I encourage you to follow that thread.
There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches
than meets the eye.Aikido for StartupsBut I don't expect to convince anyone 
(over 25) 
to go out and learn
Lisp.  The purpose of this article is not to change anyone's mind,
but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people
who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it
isn't widely used.  In a competitive situation, that's an advantage.
Lisp's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don't
get it.If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn't worry that
it isn't widely understood.  You should hope that it stays that
way. And it's likely to.  It's the nature of programming languages
to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.
Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that
programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the
processor.  At places like MIT they were writing programs in
high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued
to write code in machine language well into the 1980s.  I bet a
lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor,
like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them
out by switching to a risc instruction set.Ordinarily technology changes fast.  But programming languages are
different: programming languages are not just technology, but what
programmers think in.  They're half technology and half religion.[6]
And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median
programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  Garbage collection,
introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be
a good thing.  Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity.
Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now,
just barely, on the radar screen.  Macros, introduced by Lisp in the
mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum.  I'm not
proposing that you can fight this powerful force.  What I'm proposing
is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you
can use it against your opponents.If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  You will have
a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build
things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other
language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over
the world.  But if you work for a startup that doesn't have
pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub
paradox to your advantage:  you can use technology that your
competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be
able to match.If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here's a handy
tip for evaluating competitors.  Read their job listings.  Everything
else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent,
but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or
they'll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.
A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month
or so.  The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they
had a live online demo, was look at their job listings.  After a
couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about
and which not to.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions
had, the less dangerous the company was.  The safest kind were the
ones that wanted Oracle experience.  You never had to worry about
those.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java
developers.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would
be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company
where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.  If I
had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have
been really worried.
Notes[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp,
which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system,
written in C, which handled orders.  The first version was mostly
Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  Later we added two
more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office
manager written mostly in Perl.In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor 
written in C++ and Perl.  It's hard to say whether the program is no
longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program
into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source
files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I
know,  Lisp code.  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because
even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't
have understood why:  "If they were that smart they'd already be
programming in Lisp."[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing
equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care
about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of
power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but
one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features
you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an
interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A
has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B
doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you
can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  But if A supports,
say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something
you can fix by writing library functions.[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top;
it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at
least a partial order.[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.
In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp
features like lexical closures and rest parameters.[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take
the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly
neutral that they're really works of anthropology.  People who
value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  But the question
is only half a religious one; there is something there worth
studying, especially if you want to design new languages.

Want to start a startup?  Get funded by
Y Combinator.




October 2014(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's startup class at
Stanford.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my own kids?"  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.Startups are very counterintuitive.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's
just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.
But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can't always trust your instincts.It's like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At
first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you
start down the hill.Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for
startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.
CounterintuitiveThe first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot
of mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them.When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore.  It's really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice?  Well, that's the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.
They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors.
[1]You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you
have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems
slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with
people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.
ExpertiseThe second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important
to know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is
not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users
and the problem you're solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he
understood his users really well.If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,
don't feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn
when you need to, and forget after you've done it.In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great
detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat
dangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible
notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I
wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers."
It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic
mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting
a startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money
at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.
From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next
step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually
realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all
the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing
that's actually essential: making something people want.
GameWe saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing
house.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason
young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is
because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives
up to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into
college, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in
college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There
will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when
you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance
it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point
where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives
to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a
startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new
game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for
startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the
tricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to
convince investors is to make a startup
that's actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply
tell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for
growing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is
simply to make something people want.So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders
begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the partner replying
"Just..."Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,
I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about
startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops
working.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work
for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can
succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression
of productivity, and so on. 
[2]
But that doesn't work with startups.
There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is
whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal
as physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper
only to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.
If you're super good at sounding like you know what you're talking
about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two
rounds of funding.  But it's not in your interest to.  The company
is ultimately doomed.  All you're doing is wasting your own time
riding it down.So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as
there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less
important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing
about fundraising but has made something users love will have an
easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the
book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder
who has made something users love is the one who will go on to
succeed after raising the money.Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of
your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the
system stops working when you start a startup.  It's exciting that
there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good
work.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all
like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot
of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.
[3]
I would
have been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts
of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,
and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this
variation is one of the most important things to consider when
you're thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of
work, and what would you like to win by doing?
[4]
All-ConsumingThat brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are
all-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life
to a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it
will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the
very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working
life.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects
of it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as
fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to
catch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google
empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal
with it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's
backlog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,
partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or
weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy
if they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange
side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder
is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called
big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same
thing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.
You're worrying about construction delays at your London office
instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.
But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it
increases.Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that
it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.
And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of
things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many
of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And
since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in
rich countries do.Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're
supposed to start them while they're still in college.  Are you
crazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of
their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,
and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup
incubators left and right.To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot
of incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,
at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So
students who want to start startups hope universities can teach
them about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,
there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants
to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They
can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this
is not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the
needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually
start the company.
[5]
So starting a startup is intrinsically
something you can only really learn by doing it.  And it's impossible
to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups
take over your life.  You can't start a startup for real as a
student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even
be that for long.
[6]Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be
a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and
not be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a
startup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a
bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life.
And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot
of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.
Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most
people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before
or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel
super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,
this sort of thing is the dreaded "failure to launch," but for the
ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.
If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,
you'll never get to do it.
[7]Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He
can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity
out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running
Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a
project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to
serendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it
gives you more options to choose your life's work from.There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything
if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely
to succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and
one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face
a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run
with it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders
to make them take off, and it's gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.
TryShould you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound
pretty hard.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup
is really hard.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're
up to this challenge?The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your
life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might
be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football
player.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done
much that was like being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you're trying
to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,
and who can do that?For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would
have what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become.  There
may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,
so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the
answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure
they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few,
artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far.  Others arrive
wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever
mistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlation
between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies
do.I've read that the same is true in the military — that the
swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really
tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that
the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous
lives.If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably
shouldn't do it.  But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to
it, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.
IdeasSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in
college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and
cofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leads
to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get
startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.I've written a whole essay on this,
so I won't repeat it all here.  But the short version is that if
you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas
you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,
meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're
bad.The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even
realize at first that they're startup ideas.This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies.Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas
form in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,
then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you
like and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get
cofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of "learn a lot about
things that matter," I wrote "become good at some technology." But
that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What was
special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were
experts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps even
more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making
projects happen.  So you don't have to work on technology per se,
so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in
the general case.  History is full of examples of young people who
were working on important problems that no
one else at the time thought were important, and in particular
that their parents didn't think were important.  On the other hand,
history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their
kids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do you
know when you're working on real stuff?
[8]I know how I know.  Real problems are interesting, and I am
self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting
things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially
if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make
myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be
important.My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just
because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful
in some worldly way.  Y
Combinator itself was something I only did because it seemed
interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that
helps me out.  But I don't know what other people have in their
heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics
for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment
the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that
if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging
it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.
And indeed, probably also the best way to live.
[9]But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an
interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.
If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a
sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents
an interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mind
into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the
leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul
Buchheit put it, to "live in the future." When you reach that point,
ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem
obvious to you.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but
you'll know they're something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student
of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.
He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it
into one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without
paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on
networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn
the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did
any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this
is exactly the way the best startups get started.So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want
to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational
version of college focused on "entrepreneurship." It's the classic
version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to
start a startup after college, what you should do in college is
learn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectual
curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just
follow your own inclinations.
[10]The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain
expertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert
on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be
driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for
curiosity.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior
motive toward the end of the process.So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,
boiled down to two words: just learn.
Notes[1]
Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a
predictor of success. One of the things I
remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2]
In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  If
big companies weren't plagued by internal inefficiencies, they'd
be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.[3]
In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on schleps, but this sort of work is merely
unglamorous, not bogus.[4]
What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system?
Management consulting.[5]
The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get
significant numbers of users, you've started it, whether you realize
it yet or not.[6]
It shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach
students how to be good startup founders, because they can't teach
them how to be good employees either.The way universities "teach" students how to be employees is to
hand off the task to companies via internship programs.  But you
couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition
if the students did well they would never come back.[7]
Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel
aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.  It was only because he was
otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he
could accept it. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know
his name.[8]
Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this
department.  There are some whose definition of important problems
includes only those on the critical path to med school.[9]
I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you
have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring
ideas intolerable.  Could you endure studying literary theory, or
working in middle management at a large company?[10]
In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick
even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past
generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a
job after college, they thought at least a little about how the
courses they took might look to an employer.  And perhaps even
worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they
get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Good
news: users don't care what your GPA
was.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  Y Combinator
certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades
you got in them.

# PocketFlow Agent with A2A Protocol

This project demonstrates how to take an existing agent built with the PocketFlow library and make it accessible to other agents using the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol**.

This implementation is based  on the tutorial: [A2A Protocol Simply Explained: Here are 3 key differences to MCP!](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/a2a-protocol-simply-explained-here)

## How it Works: A2A Integration

This project combines two main parts:

1.  **PocketFlow Agent Logic:** The original agent code ([`nodes.py`](nodes.py), [`utils.py`](utils.py), [`flow.py`](flow.py)) defines the internal workflow (Decide -> Search -> Answer). This code is taken directly from the [PocketFlow Agent Tutorial](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/tree/main/cookbook/pocketflow-agent).
2.  **A2A Server Wrapper:** Code from the [google/A2A samples repository](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/python) (`common/` directory) provides the necessary infrastructure to host the agent as an A2A-compliant server. *Note: Minor modifications were made to the common server/client code to add detailed logging for educational purposes.*
3.  **The Bridge ([`task_manager.py`](task_manager.py)):** A custom `PocketFlowTaskManager` class acts as the bridge. It receives A2A requests (like `tasks/send`), extracts the user query, runs the PocketFlow `agent_flow`, takes the final result from the flow's shared state, and packages it back into an A2A `Task` object with the answer as an `Artifact`.

This demonstrates how a non-A2A agent framework can be exposed over the A2A protocol by implementing a specific `TaskManager`.

## Simplified Interaction Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as "Client ([minimal_a2a_client.py](a2a_client.py))"
    participant Server as "Server (localhost:10003)"
    
    Note over Client: User enters question
    Client->>+Server: POST / (JSON-RPC Request: tasks/send)
    Note over Server: Processes request internally (runs PocketFlow)
    Server-->>-Client: HTTP 200 OK (JSON-RPC Response: result=Task)
    Note over Client: Displays final answer
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+ (due to type hinting used in the A2A `common` code)
*   An OpenAI API Key

### Installation


1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

    Let's do a quick check to make sure your API key is working properly:

    ```bash
    python utils.py
    ```
3. Run the server from this directory:

    ```bash
    python a2a_server.py --port 10003
    ```

    You should see logs indicating the server has started on `http://localhost:10003`.


4.  Run the Client in a *separate terminal* 

    ```bash
    python a2a_client.py --agent-url http://localhost:10003
    ```

5.  Follow the instructions in the client terminal to ask questions. Type `:q` or `quit` to exit the client.

## Key A2A Integration Points

To make the PocketFlow agent A2A-compatible, the following were essential:

1.  **A2A Server ([`common/server/server.py`](common/server/server.py)):** An ASGI application (using Starlette/Uvicorn) that listens for HTTP POST requests, parses JSON-RPC, and routes requests based on the `method` field.
2.  **A2A Data Types ([`common/types.py`](common/types.py)):** Pydantic models defining the structure of A2A messages, tasks, artifacts, errors, and the agent card, ensuring compliance with the `a2a.json` specification.
3.  **Task Manager ([`task_manager.py`](task_manager.py)):** A custom class (`PocketFlowTaskManager`) inheriting from the common `InMemoryTaskManager`. Its primary role is implementing the `on_send_task` method (and potentially others like `on_send_task_subscribe` if streaming were supported). This method:
    *   Receives the validated A2A `SendTaskRequest`.
    *   Extracts the user's query (`TextPart`) from the request's `message`.
    *   Initializes the PocketFlow `shared_data` dictionary.
    *   Creates and runs the PocketFlow `agent_flow`.
    *   Retrieves the final answer from the `shared_data` dictionary *after* the flow completes.
    *   Updates the task's state (e.g., to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`) in the `InMemoryTaskManager`'s store.
    *   Packages the final answer into an A2A `Artifact` containing a `TextPart`.
    *   Constructs the final A2A `Task` object for the response.
4.  **Agent Card ([`a2a_server.py`](a2a_server.py)):** A Pydantic model (`AgentCard`) defining the agent's metadata (name, description, URL, capabilities, skills) served at `/.well-known/agent.json`.
5.  **Server Entry Point ([`a2a_server.py`](a2a_server.py)):** A script that initializes the `AgentCard`, the `PocketFlowTaskManager`, and the `A2AServer`, then starts the Uvicorn server process.

# Research Agent

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful LLM-powered research agent. This implementation is based directly on the tutorial: [LLM Agents are simply Graph — Tutorial For Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/llm-agent-internal-as-a-graph-tutorial).

👉 Run the tutorial in your browser: [Try Google Colab Notebook](
https://colab.research.google.com/github/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/blob/main/cookbook/pocketflow-agent/demo.ipynb)

## Features

- Performs web searches to gather information
- Makes decisions about when to search vs. when to answer
- Generates comprehensive answers based on research findings

## Getting Started

1. Install the packages you need with this simple command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Let's get your OpenAI API key ready:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

3. Let's do a quick check to make sure your API key is working properly:

```bash
python utils.py
```

This will test both the LLM call and web search features. If you see responses, you're good to go!

4. Try out the agent with the default question (about Nobel Prize winners):

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Got a burning question? Ask anything you want by using the `--` prefix:

```bash
python main.py --"What is quantum computing?"
```

## How It Works?

The magic happens through a simple but powerful graph structure with three main parts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[DecideAction] -->|"search"| B[SearchWeb]
    A -->|"answer"| C[AnswerQuestion]
    B -->|"decide"| A
```

Here's what each part does:
1. **DecideAction**: The brain that figures out whether to search or answer
2. **SearchWeb**: The researcher that goes out and finds information
3. **AnswerQuestion**: The writer that crafts the final answer

Here's what's in each file:
- [`main.py`](./main.py): The starting point - runs the whole show!
- [`flow.py`](./flow.py): Connects everything together into a smart agent
- [`nodes.py`](./nodes.py): The building blocks that make decisions and take actions
- [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Helper functions for talking to the LLM and searching the web

# PocketFlow Async Basic Example

This example demonstrates async operations using a simple Recipe Finder that:
1. Fetches recipes from an API (async HTTP)
2. Processes them with an LLM (async LLM)
3. Waits for user confirmation (async input)

## What this Example Does

When you run the example:
1. You enter an ingredient (e.g., "chicken")
2. It searches for recipes (async API call)
3. It suggests a recipe (async LLM call)
4. You approve or reject the suggestion
5. If rejected, it tries again with a different recipe

## How it Works

1. **FetchRecipes (AsyncNode)**
   ```python
   async def prep_async(self, shared):
       ingredient = input("Enter ingredient: ")
       return ingredient

   async def exec_async(self, ingredient):
       # Async API call
       recipes = await fetch_recipes(ingredient)
       return recipes
   ```

2. **SuggestRecipe (AsyncNode)**
   ```python
   async def exec_async(self, recipes):
       # Async LLM call
       suggestion = await call_llm_async(
           f"Choose best recipe from: {recipes}"
       )
       return suggestion
   ```

3. **GetApproval (AsyncNode)**
   ```python
   async def post_async(self, shared, prep_res, suggestion):
       # Async user input
       answer = await get_user_input(
           f"Accept {suggestion}? (y/n): "
       )
       return "accept" if answer == "y" else "retry"
   ```

## Running the Example

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Sample Interaction

```
Enter ingredient: chicken
Fetching recipes...
Found 3 recipes.

Suggesting best recipe...
How about: Grilled Chicken with Herbs

Accept this recipe? (y/n): n
Suggesting another recipe...
How about: Chicken Stir Fry

Accept this recipe? (y/n): y
Great choice! Here's your recipe...
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Async Operations**: Using `async/await` for:
   - API calls (non-blocking I/O)
   - LLM calls (potentially slow)
   - User input (waiting for response)

2. **AsyncNode Methods**:
   - `prep_async`: Setup and data gathering
   - `exec_async`: Main async processing
   - `post_async`: Post-processing and decisions

3. **Flow Control**:
   - Actions ("accept"/"retry") control flow
   - Retry loop for rejected suggestions

# Batch Translation Process

This project demonstrates a batch processing implementation that enables LLMs to translate documents into multiple languages simultaneously. It's designed to efficiently handle the translation of markdown files while preserving formatting.

## Features

- Translates markdown content into multiple languages in parallel
- Saves translated files to specified output directory

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

3. Run the translation process:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

The implementation uses a `TranslateTextNode` that processes batches of translation requests:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    batch[TranslateTextNode]
```

The `TranslateTextNode`:
1. Prepares batches for multiple language translations
2. Executes translations in parallel using the model
3. Saves the translated content to individual files
4. Maintains the original markdown structure

This approach demonstrates how PocketFlow can efficiently process multiple related tasks in parallel.

## Example Output

When you run the translation process, you'll see output similar to this:

```
Translated Chinese text
Translated Spanish text
Translated Japanese text
Translated German text
Translated Russian text
Translated Portuguese text
Translated French text
Translated Korean text
Saved translation to translations/README_CHINESE.md
Saved translation to translations/README_SPANISH.md
Saved translation to translations/README_JAPANESE.md
Saved translation to translations/README_GERMAN.md
Saved translation to translations/README_RUSSIAN.md
Saved translation to translations/README_PORTUGUESE.md
Saved translation to translations/README_FRENCH.md
Saved translation to translations/README_KOREAN.md

=== Translation Complete ===
Translations saved to: translations
============================
```

## Files

- [`main.py`](./main.py): Implementation of the batch translation node
- [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Simple wrapper for calling the Anthropic model
- [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt): Project dependencies

The translations are saved to the `translations` directory, with each file named according to the target language.

# PocketFlow BatchFlow Example

This example demonstrates the BatchFlow concept in PocketFlow by implementing an image processor that applies different filters to multiple images.

## What this Example Demonstrates

- How to use BatchFlow to run a Flow multiple times with different parameters
- Key concepts of BatchFlow:
  1. Creating a base Flow for single-item processing
  2. Using BatchFlow to process multiple items with different parameters
  3. Managing parameters across multiple Flow executions

## Project Structure
```

├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── images/
│   ├── cat.jpg        # Sample image 1
│   ├── dog.jpg        # Sample image 2
│   └── bird.jpg       # Sample image 3
├── main.py            # Entry point
├── flow.py            # Flow and BatchFlow definitions
└── nodes.py           # Node implementations for image processing
```

## How it Works

The example processes multiple images with different filters:

1. **Base Flow**: Processes a single image
   - Load image
   - Apply filter (grayscale, blur, or sepia)
   - Save processed image

2. **BatchFlow**: Processes multiple image-filter combinations
   - Takes a list of parameters (image + filter combinations)
   - Runs the base Flow for each parameter set
   - Organizes output in a structured way

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Sample Output

```
Processing images with filters...

Processing cat.jpg with grayscale filter...
Processing cat.jpg with blur filter...
Processing dog.jpg with sepia filter...
...

All images processed successfully!
Check the 'output' directory for results.
```

## Key Concepts Illustrated

1. **Parameter Management**: Shows how BatchFlow manages different parameter sets
2. **Flow Reuse**: Demonstrates running the same Flow multiple times
3. **Batch Processing**: Shows how to process multiple items efficiently
4. **Real-world Application**: Provides a practical example of batch processing

# PocketFlow BatchNode Example

This example demonstrates the BatchNode concept in PocketFlow by implementing a CSV processor that handles large files by processing them in chunks.

## What this Example Demonstrates

- How to use BatchNode to process large inputs in chunks
- The three key methods of BatchNode:
  1. `prep`: Splits input into chunks
  2. `exec`: Processes each chunk independently
  3. `post`: Combines results from all chunks

## Project Structure
```
pocketflow-batch-node/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── data/
│   └── sales.csv      # Sample large CSV file
├── main.py            # Entry point
├── flow.py            # Flow definition
└── nodes.py           # BatchNode implementation
```

## How it Works

The example processes a large CSV file containing sales data:

1. **Chunking (prep)**: The CSV file is read and split into chunks of N rows
2. **Processing (exec)**: Each chunk is processed to calculate:
   - Total sales
   - Average sale value
   - Number of transactions
3. **Combining (post)**: Results from all chunks are aggregated into final statistics

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Sample Output

```
Processing sales.csv in chunks...

Final Statistics:
- Total Sales: $1,234,567.89
- Average Sale: $123.45
- Total Transactions: 10,000
```

## Key Concepts Illustrated

1. **Chunk-based Processing**: Shows how BatchNode handles large inputs by breaking them into manageable pieces
2. **Independent Processing**: Demonstrates how each chunk is processed separately
3. **Result Aggregation**: Shows how individual results are combined into a final output

#  Simple PocketFlow Chat

A basic chat application using PocketFlow with OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

## Features

- Conversational chat interface in the terminal
- Maintains full conversation history for context
- Simple implementation demonstrating PocketFlow's node and flow concepts

## Run It

1. Make sure your OpenAI API key is set:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can edit the `utils.py` file to include your API key directly.

2. Install requirements and run the application:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    chat[ChatNode] -->|continue| chat
```

The chat application uses:
- A single `ChatNode` with a self-loop that:
  - Takes user input in the `prep` method
  - Sends the complete conversation history to GPT-4o
  - Adds responses to the conversation history
  - Loops back to continue the chat until the user types 'exit'

#  Travel Advisor Chat with Guardrails

A travel-focused chat application using PocketFlow with OpenAI's GPT-4o model, enhanced with input validation to ensure only travel-related queries are processed.

## Features

- Travel advisor chatbot that answers questions about destinations, planning, accommodations, etc.
- **Topic-specific guardrails** to ensure only travel-related queries are accepted

## Run It

1. Make sure your OpenAI API key is set:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can edit the `utils.py` file to include your API key directly.

2. Install requirements and run the application:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    user[UserInputNode] -->|validate| guardrail[GuardrailNode]
    guardrail -->|retry| user
    guardrail -->|process| llm[LLMNode]
    llm -->|continue| user
```

The chat application uses:
- A `UserInputNode` that collects user input in its `exec` method
- A `GuardrailNode` that validates if the query is travel-related using:
  - Basic validation checks (empty input, too short)
  - LLM-based validation to determine if the query relates to travel
- An `LLMNode` that processes valid travel queries using GPT-4o with a travel advisor system prompt
- Flow connections that route inputs through validation before processing and handle retries for non-travel related queries

## Files

- [`main.py`](./main.py): Implementation of the nodes and chat flow
- [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Utilities for calling the OpenAI API

## Example Outputs

``` 
Welcome to the Travel Advisor Chat! Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

You: Plan my trip to Thailand

Travel Advisor: Thailand offers a blend of vibrant cities, serene beaches, and rich culture. Begin in Bangkok to explore the Grand Palace and local markets. Head north to Chiang Mai for temples and elephant sanctuaries. Fly south to the islands; Phuket or Koh Samui for beaches, diving, and nightlife. Consider visiting during the cool season (November-February) for pleasant weather. Accommodation ranges from budget hostels to luxury resorts. Internal flights, trains, and buses connect major destinations. Don’t miss local cuisine, from street food to fine dining. Ensure your passport is valid for six months and consider travel insurance for peace of mind. Enjoy!

You: exit

Goodbye! Safe travels!
```

```
Welcome to the Travel Advisor Chat! Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

You: How to study large language models?

Travel Advisor: The query is not related to travel advice, destinations, planning, or other travel topics. It is about studying large language models, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

You: exit

Goodbye! Safe travels!

# PocketFlow Chat with Memory

A chat application with memory retrieval using PocketFlow. This example maintains a sliding window of recent conversations while retrieving relevant past conversations based on context. 

This implementation is based directly on the tutorial: [Build AI Agent Memory From Scratch — Tutorial For Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/build-ai-agent-memory-from-scratch).

## Features

- Maintains a window of 3 most recent conversation pairs
- Archives older conversations with embeddings
- Uses vector similarity to retrieve the most relevant past conversation
- Combines recent context (3 pairs) with retrieved context (1 pair) for better responses

## Run It

1. Make sure your OpenAI API key is set:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

2. Install requirements and run the application:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```
    
## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Question[GetUserQuestionNode] -->|retrieve| Retrieve[RetrieveNode]
    Retrieve -->|answer| Answer[AnswerNode]
    Answer -->|question| Question
    Answer -->|embed| Embed[EmbedNode]
    Embed -->|question| Question
```

The chat application uses:
- Four specialized nodes:
  - `GetUserQuestionNode`: Handles interactive user input
  - `RetrieveNode`: Finds relevant past conversations using vector similarity
  - `AnswerNode`: Generates responses using both recent and retrieved context
  - `EmbedNode`: Archives older conversations with embeddings
- A sliding window approach that maintains only the 3 most recent conversation pairs in active context

- [`flow.py`](./flow.py): Chat flow structure definition
- [`main.py`](./main.py): Entry point for running the demo

# PocketFlow Command-Line Joke Generator (Human-in-the-Loop Example)

A simple, interactive command-line application that generates jokes based on user-provided topics and direct human feedback. This serves as a clear example of a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow orchestrated by PocketFlow.

## Features

- **Interactive Joke Generation**: Ask for jokes on any topic.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Dislike a joke? Your feedback directly influences the next generation attempt.
- **Minimalist Design**: A straightforward example of using PocketFlow for HITL tasks.
- **Powered by LLMs**: (Uses Anthropic Claude via an API call for joke generation).

## Getting Started

This project is part of the PocketFlow cookbook examples. It's assumed you have already cloned the [PocketFlow repository](https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow) and are in the `cookbook/pocketflow-cli-hitl` directory.

1.  **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set up your Anthropic API key**:
    The application uses Anthropic Claude to generate jokes. You need to set your API key as an environment variable.
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key-here"
    ```
    You can test if your `call_llm.py` utility is working by running it directly:
    ```bash
    python utils/call_llm.py
    ```

3.  **Run the Joke Generator**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

The system uses a simple PocketFlow workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    GetTopic[GetTopicNode] --> GenerateJoke[GenerateJokeNode]
    GenerateJoke --> GetFeedback[GetFeedbackNode]
    GetFeedback -- "Approve" --> Z((End))
    GetFeedback -- "Disapprove" --> GenerateJoke
```

1.  **GetTopicNode**: Prompts the user to enter a topic for the joke.
2.  **GenerateJokeNode**: Sends the topic (and any previously disliked jokes as context) to an LLM to generate a new joke.
3.  **GetFeedbackNode**: Shows the joke to the user and asks if they liked it.
    *   If **yes** (approved), the application ends.
    *   If **no** (disapproved), the disliked joke is recorded, and the flow loops back to `GenerateJokeNode` to try again.

## Sample Output

Here's an example of an interaction with the Joke Generator:

```
Welcome to the Command-Line Joke Generator!
What topic would you like a joke about? Pocket Flow: 100-line LLM framework

Joke: Pocket Flow: Finally, an LLM framework that fits in your pocket! Too bad your model still needs a data center.
Did you like this joke? (yes/no): no
Okay, let me try another one.

Joke: Pocket Flow: A 100-line LLM framework where 99 lines are imports and the last line is `print("TODO: implement intelligence")`.
Did you like this joke? (yes/no): yes
Great! Glad you liked it.

Thanks for using the Joke Generator!

# Design Doc: Command-Line Joke Generator

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

The system will be a command-line application that:
1. Asks the user for a topic for a joke.
2. Generates a joke based on the provided topic.
3. Asks the user if they approve of the joke.
4. If the user approves, the application can end or offer to generate another joke (for simplicity, we'll end for now).
5. If the user does not approve, the application should:
    a. Take note that the user disliked the previous joke.
    b. Generate a new joke about the same topic, attempting to make it different from the disliked one.
    c. Repeat step 3.

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

**Agent**: The system acts as an agent that interacts with the user. It takes user input (topic, feedback), performs an action (generates a joke), and then decides the next step based on user feedback (either end or try generating another joke). This iterative process of generation and feedback fits the agent pattern.

### Flow high-level Design:

1.  **GetTopicNode**: Prompts the user to enter the topic for the joke.
2.  **GenerateJokeNode**: Generates a joke based on the topic and any previous feedback.
3.  **GetFeedbackNode**: Presents the joke to the user and asks for approval. Based on the feedback, it either transitions to end the flow or back to `GenerateJokeNode`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    GetTopic[GetTopicNode] --> GenerateJoke[GenerateJokeNode]
    GenerateJoke --> GetFeedback[GetFeedbackNode]
    GetFeedback -- "Approve" --> Z((End))
    GetFeedback -- "Disapprove" --> GenerateJoke
```
## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1.  **Call LLM** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
    *   *Input*: `prompt` (str), potentially including context like previously disliked jokes.
    *   *Output*: `response` (str) - the generated joke.
    *   *Necessity*: Used by `GenerateJokeNode` to generate jokes.

## Node Design

### Shared Store

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared store structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "topic": None,             # Stores the user-provided joke topic
    "current_joke": None,      # Stores the most recently generated joke
    "disliked_jokes": [],    # A list to store jokes the user didn't like, for context
    "user_feedback": None      # Stores the user's latest feedback (e.g., "approve", "disapprove")
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1.  **GetTopicNode**
    *   *Purpose*: To get the desired joke topic from the user.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   `prep`: (None needed for the first run, or could check if a topic already exists if we were to loop for a new topic)
        *   `exec`: Prompt the user via `input()` for a joke topic.
        *   `post`: Store the user's input topic into `shared["topic"]`. Return `"default"` action to proceed to `GenerateJokeNode`.

2.  **GenerateJokeNode**
    *   *Purpose*: To generate a joke using an LLM, based on the topic and any previously disliked jokes.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   `prep`: Read `shared["topic"]` and `shared["disliked_jokes"]`. Construct a prompt for the LLM, including the topic and a message like "The user did not like the following jokes: [list of disliked jokes]. Please generate a new, different joke about [topic]."
        *   `exec`: Call the `call_llm` utility function with the prepared prompt.
        *   `post`: Store the generated joke in `shared["current_joke"]`. Print the joke to the console. Return `"default"` action to proceed to `GetFeedbackNode`.

3.  **GetFeedbackNode**
    *   *Purpose*: To get feedback from the user about the generated joke and decide the next step.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   `prep`: Read `shared["current_joke"]`.
        *   `exec`: Prompt the user (e.g., "Did you like this joke? (yes/no) or (approve/disapprove): "). Get user's input.
        *   `post`:
            *   If user input indicates approval (e.g., "yes", "approve"):
                *   Store "approve" in `shared["user_feedback"]`.
                *   Return `"Approve"` action (leading to flow termination or a thank you message).
            *   If user input indicates disapproval (e.g., "no", "disapprove"):
                *   Store "disapprove" in `shared["user_feedback"]`.
                *   Add `shared["current_joke"]` to the `shared["disliked_jokes"]` list.
                *   Return `"Disapprove"` action (leading back to `GenerateJokeNode`).

# PocketFlow Code Generator

An intelligent AI system that takes LeetCode-style coding problems and automatically generates comprehensive test cases, implements solutions, and iteratively improves them until all tests pass.

- Check out the [Substack Post Tutorial](https://pocketflow.substack.com/p/build-your-own-ai-code-generator) for more!

## Features

- **Automatic Test Case Generation**: Creates diverse test cases including edge cases
- **Intelligent Code Implementation**: Generates `run_code` functions with proper algorithms
- **Iterative Improvement**: Analyzes failures and decides whether to revise tests or code
- **Rich Debugging Output**: Detailed progress tracking and validation

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up your Anthropic API key:
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    Test your API key is working:
    ```bash
    python utils/call_llm.py
    ```

3. Run the code generator with the default Two Sum problem:
```bash
python main.py
```

4. Or provide your own problem:
```bash
python main.py "Reverse a linked list. Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list."
```

## How It Works

The system follows an intelligent workflow combining **Agent** and **Workflow** design patterns:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start[Problem Input] --> generateTests[Generate Test Cases]
    generateTests --> implement[Implement Function]
    implement --> runTests[Run Tests - Batch]
    runTests --> decision{All Tests Pass?}
    decision -->|Yes| success[Success!]
    decision -->|No| revise[Revise - Agent Decision]
    revise --> runTests
    decision -->|Max Iterations| maxIter[Max Iterations Reached]
```

### The Process

1. **GenerateTestCases**: Creates 5-7 comprehensive test cases from problem description
2. **ImplementFunction**: Writes a `run_code` function based on problem and test cases  
3. **RunTests**: Executes function against all test cases using batch processing
4. **Revise**: Analyzes failures and makes intelligent decisions to revise test cases and/or function code
5. **Loop**: Continues until all tests pass or max iterations reached

## Sample Output

Here's what you'll see when running the Two Sum example:

```
Starting PocketFlow Code Generator...

=== Generated 7 Test Cases ===
1. Basic case - solution at beginning
   input: {'nums': [2, 7, 11, 15], 'target': 9}
   expected: [0, 1]
2. Basic case - solution in middle
   input: {'nums': [3, 2, 4], 'target': 6}
   expected: [1, 2]
3. Edge case - minimum array size with duplicates
   input: {'nums': [3, 3], 'target': 6}
   expected: [0, 1]
4. Case with negative numbers
   input: {'nums': [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], 'target': -8}
   expected: [2, 4]
5. Case with zero and negative target
   input: {'nums': [0, 4, 3, 0], 'target': 0}
   expected: [0, 3]
6. Case with solution at the end
   input: {'nums': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'target': 11}
   expected: [4, 5]
7. Larger array case
   input: {'nums': [5, 75, 25, 45, 42, 2, 11, 9, 55, 12], 'target': 14}
   expected: [2, 6]

=== Implemented Function ===
def run_code(nums, target):
    # Dictionary to store number -> index mapping
    num_to_index = {}
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate what number we need to reach the target
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement exists in our map
        if complement in num_to_index:
            # Found the pair! Return indices
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        
        # Store current number and its index
        num_to_index[num] = i
    
    # Should never reach here given problem constraints
    return []

=== Test Results: 6/7 Passed ===
Failed tests:
1. Larger array case:
   error: Expected [2, 6], got [0, 7]
   expected: [2, 6]

=== Revisions (Iteration 1) ===
Revising test cases:
  Test 7: 'Larger array case' -> 'Larger array case'
    old input: {'nums': [5, 75, 25, 45, 42, 2, 11, 9, 55, 12], 'target': 14}
    new input: {'nums': [5, 75, 25, 45, 42, 2, 11, 9, 55, 12], 'target': 14}
    old expected: [2, 6]
    new expected: [0, 7]

=== Test Results: 7/7 Passed ===
```

## Key Features

### Intelligent Decision Making
The **Revise** node acts as an agent that analyzes test failures and decides whether to:
- Fix test cases (if they have incorrect expected outputs)  
- Fix the function implementation (if the logic is wrong)
- Or both

### Structured Output with Validation
All LLM interactions use YAML format with:
- **Reasoning fields**: Transparent decision-making process
- **Validation asserts**: Ensures outputs match expected structure
- **Rich debugging**: Comprehensive logging of all steps

### Batch Processing
The **RunTests** node uses PocketFlow's BatchNode to efficiently test the function against all test cases in parallel.

# Design Doc: PocketFlow Code Generator

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

**User Story**: As a developer, I want an AI system that can take a LeetCode-style coding problem and automatically:
1. Generate comprehensive test cases including edge cases
2. Implement a solution function
3. Test the implementation against the test cases
4. When tests fail, intelligently decide whether to revise the test cases or the function
5. Iterate until all tests pass

**Sample Problem**: Two Sum - Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.

This is well-suited for AI because:
- ✅ Routine task: Test case generation follows patterns
- ✅ Creative task: Code generation from clear problem descriptions  
- ✅ Clear decision criteria: Whether to revise tests vs implementation

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

1. **Workflow Pattern**: Sequential steps of test generation → coding → testing
2. **Agent Pattern**: Decision-making when tests fail with structured output
   - *Context*: Test results, current test cases, and function code
   - *Actions*: Structured output to revise test cases and/or function

### Flow high-level Design:

1. **Generate Test Cases**: Create comprehensive input/output test pairs from problem description
2. **Implement Function**: Write `def run_code` function based on problem and current test cases  
3. **Run Tests**: Execute function against all test cases using batch processing
4. **Revise**: Analyze failures and output structured revisions for test cases and/or function
5. **Loop back to Run Tests** until all pass

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start[Problem Input] --> generateTests[Generate Test Cases]
    generateTests --> implement[Implement Function]
    implement --> runTests[Run Tests - Batch]
    runTests --> decision{All Tests Pass?}
    decision -->|Yes| success[Success!]
    decision -->|No| revise[Revise]
    revise --> runTests
```

## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1. **Call LLM** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
   - *Input*: prompt (str)
   - *Output*: response (str)
   - Used by all LLM-powered nodes for generating tests, code, and analysis

2. **Execute Python Code** (`utils/code_executor.py`)
   - *Input*: function_code (str), input (dict/list/any)
   - *Output*: output (any), error (str)
   - Used by RunTests batch node to safely execute generated code against individual input

## Node Design

### Shared Memory

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared memory structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "problem": "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.",
    "test_cases": [
        {"name": "Basic case", "input": {"nums": [2,7,11,15], "target": 9}, "expected": [0,1]},
        {"name": "Different order", "input": {"nums": [3,2,4], "target": 6}, "expected": [1,2]},
        # ... more test cases
    ],
    "function_code": "def run_code(nums, target): ...",
    "test_results": [
        {"test_case": {...}, "passed": True/False, "error": "..."},
        # ... results for each test case
    ],
    "iteration_count": 0,
    "max_iterations": 5
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1. **GenerateTestCases Node**
  - *Purpose*: Create comprehensive test cases including edge cases from problem description
  - *Type*: Regular Node
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read problem description from shared store
    - *exec*: Call LLM to generate diverse test cases in structured format
    - *post*: Store test cases directly in shared["test_cases"]

2. **ImplementFunction Node**
  - *Purpose*: Generate `def run_code` function based on problem and current test cases
  - *Type*: Regular Node  
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read problem description and test cases from shared store
    - *exec*: Call LLM to implement `def run_code` function with clean code output
    - *post*: Store function code directly in shared["function_code"]

3. **RunTests Node**
  - *Purpose*: Execute function against all test cases using batch processing
  - *Type*: Batch Node
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read function code from shared store, return list of test cases
    - *exec*: Use code executor utility to run function against each individual test case
    - *post*: Store all results in shared["test_results"], return "success" if all pass else "failure"

4. **Revise Node** (Agent with Structured Output)
  - *Purpose*: Analyze test failures and output structured revisions for test cases and/or function
  - *Type*: Regular Node (Agent decision-making)
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read test results, test cases, function code, iteration count from shared store
    - *exec*: Call LLM to analyze failures and output structured YAML with revised test cases and/or function code
    - *post*: Update shared["test_cases"] and/or shared["function_code"] based on structured output

# PocketFlow Communication Example

This example demonstrates the [Communication](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/communication.html) concept in PocketFlow, specifically focusing on the Shared Store pattern.

## Overview

The example implements a simple word counter that shows how nodes can communicate using a shared store. It demonstrates:

- How to initialize and structure a shared store
- How nodes can read from and write to the shared store
- How to maintain state across multiple node executions
- Best practices for shared store usage

## Project Structure

```
pocketflow-communication/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
├── flow.py
└── nodes.py
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter text when prompted. The program will:
1. Count words in the text
2. Store statistics in the shared store
3. Display running statistics (total texts, total words, average)

Enter 'q' to quit.

## How it Works

The example uses three nodes:

1. `TextInput`: Reads user input and initializes the shared store
2. `WordCounter`: Counts words and updates statistics in the shared store
3. `ShowStats`: Displays statistics from the shared store

This demonstrates how nodes can share and maintain state using the shared store pattern.

# PocketFlow FastAPI Background Jobs with Real-time Progress

A web application demonstrating PocketFlow workflows running as FastAPI background jobs with real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="./assets/banner.png" width="800"
  />
</p>

## Features

- **Modern Web UI**: Clean interface with real-time progress visualization
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking article generation using FastAPI BackgroundTasks
- **Server-Sent Events**: Real-time progress streaming without polling
- **Granular Progress**: Section-by-section updates during content generation
- **PocketFlow Integration**: Three-node workflow (Outline → Content → Style)

## How to Run

1. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI Server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Access the Web UI:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

5. Use the Application:
   - Enter an article topic or click suggested topics
   - Click "Generate Article" to start background processing
   - Watch real-time progress updates with step indicators
   - Copy the final article when complete

## How It Works

The application uses PocketFlow to define a three-step article generation workflow. FastAPI handles web requests and manages real-time SSE communication for progress updates.

**PocketFlow Workflow:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Generate Outline] --> B[Write Content]
    B --> C[Apply Style]
```

1. **`GenerateOutline`**: Creates structured outline with up to 3 sections
2. **`WriteContent` (BatchNode)**: Writes content for each section individually, sending progress updates
3. **`ApplyStyle`**: Polishes the article with conversational tone

**FastAPI & SSE Integration:**

- The `/start-job` endpoint creates a unique job, initializes an SSE queue, and schedules the workflow using `BackgroundTasks`
- Nodes send progress updates to the job-specific `sse_queue` during execution
- The `/progress/{job_id}` endpoint streams real-time updates to the client via Server-Sent Events
- The web UI displays progress with animated bars, step indicators, and detailed status messages

**Progress Updates:**
- 33%: Outline generation complete
- 33-66%: Content writing (individual section updates)
- 66-100%: Style application
- 100%: Article ready

# Design Doc: PocketFlow FastAPI Background Job with SSE Progress

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

**User Story**: As a user, I want to submit an article topic via a web API and receive real-time progress updates while the article is being generated in the background, so I can see the workflow progress without blocking the UI.

**Core Requirements**:
1. Submit article topic via REST API endpoint
2. Start background job for article generation workflow
3. Receive real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
4. Get final article result when workflow completes
5. Handle multiple concurrent requests

**Technical Requirements**:
- FastAPI web server with REST endpoints
- Background task processing using asyncio
- Server-Sent Events for progress streaming
- Simple web interface to test the functionality

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

**Workflow Pattern**: Sequential processing of article generation steps with progress reporting at each stage.

### Flow High-level Design:

1. **Generate Outline Node**: Creates a structured outline for the article topic
2. **Write Content Node**: Writes content for each section in the outline  
3. **Apply Style Node**: Applies conversational styling to the final article

Each node puts progress updates into an asyncio.Queue for SSE streaming.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    outline[Generate Outline] --> content[Write Content]
    content --> styling[Apply Style]
```

## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1. **Call LLM** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
   - *Input*: prompt (str)
   - *Output*: response (str)
   - Used by all workflow nodes for LLM tasks

## Node Design

### Shared Store

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared store structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "topic": "user-provided-topic",
    "sse_queue": asyncio.Queue(),  # For sending SSE updates
    "sections": ["section1", "section2", "section3"],
    "draft": "combined-section-content",
    "final_article": "styled-final-article"
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1. **Generate Outline Node**
   - *Purpose*: Create a structured outline with 3 main sections using YAML output
   - *Type*: Regular Node (synchronous LLM call)
   - *Steps*:
     - *prep*: Read "topic" from shared store
     - *exec*: Call LLM to generate YAML outline, parse and validate structure
     - *post*: Write "sections" to shared store, put progress update in sse_queue

2. **Write Content Node**
   - *Purpose*: Generate concise content for each outline section
   - *Type*: BatchNode (processes each section independently)
   - *Steps*:
     - *prep*: Read "sections" from shared store (returns list of sections)
     - *exec*: For one section, call LLM to write 100-word content
     - *post*: Combine all section content into "draft", put progress update in sse_queue

3. **Apply Style Node**
   - *Purpose*: Apply conversational, engaging style to the combined content
   - *Type*: Regular Node (single LLM call for styling)
   - *Steps*:
     - *prep*: Read "draft" from shared store
     - *exec*: Call LLM to rewrite in conversational style
     - *post*: Write "final_article" to shared store, put completion update in sse_queue

# PocketFlow Web Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Feedback Service

This project demonstrates a minimal web application for human-in-the-loop workflows using PocketFlow, FastAPI, and Server-Sent Events (SSE). Users can submit text, have it processed (simulated), review the output, and approve or reject it, potentially triggering reprocessing until approved.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="./assets/banner.png" width="800"
  />
</p>

## Features

-   **Web UI:** Simple interface for submitting tasks and providing feedback.
-   **PocketFlow Workflow:** Manages the process -> review -> result/reprocess logic.
-   **FastAPI Backend:** Serves the UI and handles API requests asynchronously.
-   **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Provides real-time status updates to the client without polling.

## How to Run

1.  Install Dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  Run the FastAPI Server:
    Use Uvicorn (or another ASGI server):
    ```bash
    uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    *(The `--reload` flag is useful for development.)*

3.  Access the Web UI:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

4.  Use the Application:
    *   Enter text into the textarea and click "Submit".
    *   Observe the status updates pushed via SSE.
    *   When prompted ("waiting_for_review"), use the "Approve" or "Reject" buttons.
    *   If rejected, the process loops back. If approved, the final result is displayed.

## How It Works

The application uses PocketFlow to define and execute the feedback loop workflow. FastAPI handles web requests and manages the real-time SSE communication.

**PocketFlow Workflow:**

The core logic is orchestrated by an `AsyncFlow` defined in `flow.py`:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph FeedbackFlow[MinimalFeedbackFlow]
        Process[ProcessNode] -- default --> Review[ReviewNode]
        Review -- approved --> Result[ResultNode]
        Review -- rejected --> Process
    end
```

1.  **`ProcessNode`**: Receives input text, calls the minimal `process_task` utility, and stores the output.
2.  **`ReviewNode` (Async)**:
    *   Pushes a "waiting_for_review" status with the processed output to the SSE queue.
    *   Waits asynchronously for an external signal (triggered by the `/feedback` API endpoint).
    *   Based on the received feedback ("approved" or "rejected"), determines the next step in the flow. Stores the result if approved.
3.  **`ResultNode`**: Logs the final approved result.

**FastAPI & SSE Integration:**

*   The `/submit` endpoint creates a unique task, initializes the PocketFlow `shared` state (including an `asyncio.Event` for review and an `asyncio.Queue` for SSE), and schedules the flow execution using `BackgroundTasks`.
*   Nodes within the flow (specifically `ReviewNode`'s prep logic) put status updates onto the task-specific `sse_queue`.
*   The `/stream/{task_id}` endpoint uses `StreamingResponse` to read from the task's `sse_queue` and push formatted status updates to the connected client via Server-Sent Events.
*   The `/feedback/{task_id}` endpoint receives the human's decision, updates the `shared` state, and sets the `asyncio.Event` to unblock the waiting `ReviewNode`.

This setup allows for a decoupled workflow logic (PocketFlow) and web interaction layer (FastAPI), with efficient real-time updates pushed to the user.

#  Human-in-the-Loop Web Service

## 1. Requirements

*   **Goal:** Create a web service for task submission, processing, human review (Approve/Reject loop via UI), and finalization.
*   **Interface:** Simple web UI (HTML/JS) for input, status display, and feedback buttons.
*   **Backend:** FastAPI using PocketFlow for workflow management.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push status changes (pending, running, waiting_for_review, completed, failed) and intermediate results to the client without page reloads.
*   **State:** Use in-memory storage for task state (Warning: Not suitable for production).

## 2. Flow Design

*   **Core Pattern:** Workflow with a conditional loop based on human feedback. SSE for asynchronous status communication.
*   **Nodes:**
    1.  `ProcessNode` (Regular): Takes input, executes the (simulated) task processing.
    2.  `ReviewNode` (Async): Waits for human feedback signaled via an `asyncio.Event`. Pushes "waiting\_for\_review" status to the SSE queue.
    3.  `ResultNode` (Regular): Marks the task as complete and logs the final result.
*   **Shared Store (`shared` dict per task):**
    *   `task_input`: Initial data from user.
    *   `processed_output`: Result from `ProcessNode`.
    *   `feedback`: 'approved' or 'rejected' set by the `/feedback` endpoint.
    *   `review_event`: `asyncio.Event` used by `ReviewNode` to wait and `/feedback` to signal.
    *   `final_result`: The approved output.
    *   `current_attempt`: Tracks reprocessing count.
    *   `task_id`: Unique identifier for the task.
*   **SSE Communication:** An `asyncio.Queue` (stored alongside the `shared` store in the server's global `tasks` dict, *not directly in PocketFlow's shared store*) is used per task. Nodes (or wrapper code) put status updates onto this queue. The `/stream` endpoint reads from the queue and sends SSE messages.
*   **Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Process[Process Task] -- "default" --> Review{Wait for Feedback}
    Review -- "approved" --> Result[Final Result]
    Review -- "rejected" --> Process
```

## 3. Utilities

For this specific example, the core "utility" is the processing logic itself. Let's simulate it with a simple function. The FastAPI server acts as the external interface.

* `process_task(input_data)`: A placeholder function. In a real scenario, this might call an LLM (`utils/call_llm.py`).

## 4. Node Design (Detailed)

*   **`ProcessNode` (Node):**
    *   `prep`: Reads `task_input`, `current_attempt` from `shared`.
    *   `exec`: Calls `utils.process_task.process_task`.
    *   `post`: Writes `processed_output` to `shared`, increments `current_attempt`. Returns "default".
*   **`ReviewNode` (AsyncNode):**
    *   `prep_async`: (As modified/wrapped by server.py) Reads `review_event`, `processed_output` from `shared`. **Puts "waiting\_for\_review" status onto the task's SSE queue.**
    *   `exec_async`: `await shared["review_event"].wait()`.
    *   `post_async`: Reads `feedback` from `shared`. Clears the event. Returns "approved" or "rejected". If approved, stores `processed_output` into `final_result`.
*   **`ResultNode` (Node):**
    *   `prep`: Reads `final_result` from `shared`.
    *   `exec`: Prints/logs the final result.
    *   `post`: Returns `None` (ends flow).

# Design Doc: FastAPI WebSocket Chat Interface

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

**User Story**: As a user, I want to interact with an AI chatbot through a web interface where:
1. I can send messages and receive real-time streaming responses
2. The connection stays persistent (WebSocket)
3. I can see the AI response being typed out in real-time as the LLM generates it
4. The interface is minimal and easy to use

**Technical Requirements**:
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- True LLM streaming integration using PocketFlow AsyncNode
- Simple HTML/JavaScript frontend
- Minimal dependencies

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

**Single Async Node Pattern**: One PocketFlow AsyncNode handles the entire LLM streaming process with real-time WebSocket streaming

### Flow high-level Design:

**PocketFlow AsyncFlow**: Just one async node
1. **Streaming Chat Node**: Processes message, calls LLM with real streaming, sends chunks immediately to WebSocket

**Integration**: FastAPI WebSocket endpoint calls the PocketFlow AsyncFlow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    user((User Browser)) --> websocket(FastAPI WebSocket)
    websocket --> flow[Streaming Chat AsyncNode]
    flow --> websocket
    websocket --> user
    
    style user fill:#e1f5fe
    style websocket fill:#f3e5f5
    style flow fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#4caf50,stroke-width:3px
```

## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1. **Stream LLM** (`utils/stream_llm.py`)
   - *Input*: messages (list of chat history)
   - *Output*: generator yielding real-time response chunks from OpenAI API
   - Used by streaming chat node to get LLM chunks as they're generated

## Node Design

### Shared Store

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared store structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "websocket": None,           # WebSocket connection object
    "user_message": "",          # Current user message
    "conversation_history": []   # List of message history with roles
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1. **Streaming Chat Node**
  - *Purpose*: Process user message, call LLM with real streaming, and send chunks immediately via WebSocket
  - *Type*: AsyncNode (for real-time streaming)
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read user message, build conversation history with new message
    - *exec_async*: Call streaming LLM utility, stream each chunk immediately to WebSocket as received
    - *post*: Update conversation history with complete assistant response

# Text Converter Flow

This project demonstrates an interactive text transformation tool built with PocketFlow.

## Features

- Convert text to UPPERCASE
- Convert text to lowercase
- Reverse text
- Remove extra spaces
- Interactive command-line interface
- Continuous flow with option to process multiple texts

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

The workflow features an interactive loop with branching paths:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[TextInput Node] -->|transform| Transform[TextTransform Node]
    Transform -->|input| Input
    Transform -->|exit| End[End]
    Input -->|exit| End
```

Here's what each part does:
1. **TextInput Node**: Collects text input and handles menu choices
2. **TextTransform Node**: Applies the selected transformation to the text

## Example Output

```
Welcome to Text Converter!
=========================

Enter text to convert: Pocket Flow is a 100-line LLM framework

Choose transformation:
1. Convert to UPPERCASE
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Reverse text
4. Remove extra spaces
5. Exit

Your choice (1-5): 1

Result: POCKET FLOW IS A 100-LINE LLM FRAMEWORK

Convert another text? (y/n): n

Thank you for using Text Converter!
```

# PocketFlow Gradio HITL Example

A web-based application that demonstrates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow orchestration using PocketFlow and Gradio. This example provides an interactive interface for users to engage with AI-powered tasks while maintaining human oversight and feedback.

## Features

- **Web-based Interface**: Built with Gradio for an accessible and user-friendly experience
- **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Seamless integration of human feedback into the AI workflow
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive interface for better user interaction
- **Powered by LLMs**: Utilizes OpenAI's models for intelligent task processing
- **Flow Visualization**: Real-time visualization of node execution sequence and workflow progress
- **Interactive Debugging**: Monitor and understand the decision-making process through visual feedback

## Getting Started

This project is part of the PocketFlow cookbook examples. It's assumed you have already cloned the [PocketFlow repository](https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow) and are in the `cookbook/pocketflow-gradio-hitl` directory.

1. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:
    The application uses OpenAI models for processing. You need to set your API key as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will start the Gradio web interface, typically accessible at `http://localhost:7860`

## How It Works

The system implements a PocketFlow workflow with a web interface:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DecideAction[Decide Action Node] --> |"check-weather"| CheckWeather[Check Weather Node]
    CheckWeather --> DecideAction
    DecideAction --> |"book-hotel"| BookHotel[Book Hotel Node]
    BookHotel --> DecideAction
    DecideAction --> |"follow-up"| FollowUp[Follow Up Node]
    DecideAction --> |"result-notification"| ResultNotification[Result Notification Node]
```

The workflow consists of the following nodes:

1. **Decide Action Node**: The central decision-making node that determines the next action based on user input and context
2. **Check Weather Node**: Provides weather information for specified cities and dates
3. **Book Hotel Node**: Handles hotel reservation requests with check-in and check-out dates
4. **Follow Up Node**: Manages user interactions by asking clarifying questions or handling out-of-scope requests
5. **Result Notification Node**: Delivers action results and offers additional assistance

The flow is orchestrated through a series of directed connections:
- The Decide Action node can trigger weather checks, hotel bookings, follow-ups, or result notifications
- Weather checks and hotel bookings can feed back to the Decide Action node for further processing
- Follow-up and result notification nodes provide the final steps in the workflow

### Flow Visualization

The application provides real-time visualization of the workflow execution:
- The sequence of node activations is displayed chronologically
- Users can see which decision paths are being taken
- The visualization helps in understanding the AI's decision-making process

## Sample Output

Here's an example of book hotel:

![book hotel](./assets/book_hotel.png)

Here's an example of changing intention mid-conversation:

![change intention](./assets/change_intention.png)

## Files

- [`main.py`](./main.py): Entry point for the application and Gradio interface setup

- [`nodes.py`](./nodes.py): Contains the node definitions for the workflow
- [`utils/`](./utils/): Contains utility functions and helper modules
- [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt): Lists project dependencies

#  LLM Streaming and Interruption

Demonstrates real-time LLM response streaming with user interrupt capability.

- Check out the [Substack Post Tutorial](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/streaming-llm-responses-tutorial) for more!

## Features

- Real-time display of LLM responses as they're generated
- User interrupt with ENTER key at any time

## Run It

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## How It Works

StreamNode:
1. Creates interrupt listener thread
2. Fetches content chunks from LLM
3. Displays chunks in real-time
4. Handles user interruption

## API Key

By default, demo uses fake streaming responses. To use real OpenAI streaming:

1. Edit main.py to replace the fake_stream_llm with stream_llm:
```python
# Change this line:
chunks = fake_stream_llm(prompt)
# To this:
chunks = stream_llm(prompt)
```

2. Make sure your OpenAI API key is set:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

# Majority Vote Reasoning

This project demonstrates a majority vote implementation that enables LLMs to solve complex reasoning problems by aggregating multiple independent attempts. It's designed to improve problem-solving accuracy through consensus-based reasoning.

## Features

- Improves model reliability on complex problems through multiple attempts
- Works with models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Solves problems that single attempts often fail on
- Provides detailed reasoning traces for verification
- Uses a consensus approach to reduce the impact of occasional reasoning errors

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

3. Run a test problem to see majority voting in action:
```bash
python main.py
```

4. Try your own reasoning problem:
```bash
python main.py --problem "Your complex reasoning problem here" --tries 5
```

## How It Works

The implementation uses a MajorityVoteNode that processes multiple attempts and finds consensus:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    mv[MajorityVoteNode] 
```

The MajorityVoteNode:
1. Makes multiple independent attempts to solve the same problem
2. Collects structured answers from each attempt
3. Determines the most frequent answer as the final solution
4. Returns the consensus answer

This approach helps overcome occasional reasoning errors that might occur in individual attempts.

## Example Problem

Example Problem from [Quant Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCP7JptxPU0):

```
You work at a shoe factory. In front of you, there are three pairs of shoes (six individual shoes) with the following sizes: two size 4s, two size 5s, and two size 6s. The factory defines an "acceptable pair" as two shoes that differ in size by a maximum of one size (e.g., a size 5 and a size 6 would be an acceptable pair). If you close your eyes and randomly pick three pairs of shoes without replacement, what is the probability that you end up drawing three acceptable pairs?
```

Below is an example of how the majority vote approach uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet to solve this complex problem:

```
========================
All structured answers: ['0.333', '0.333', '0.333', '0.6', '0.333']
Majority vote => 0.333
Frequency => 4
========================

=== Final Answer ===
0.333
====================
```

This shows that 4 out of 5 attempts yielded the same answer (0.333), which is chosen as the final solution.

# Resume Qualification - Map Reduce Example

A PocketFlow example that demonstrates how to implement a Map-Reduce pattern for processing and evaluating resumes.

## Features

- Read and process multiple resume files using a Map-Reduce pattern
- Evaluate each resume individually using an LLM with structured YAML output
- Determine if candidates qualify for technical roles based on specific criteria
- Aggregate results to generate qualification statistics and summaries

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

The workflow follows a classic Map-Reduce pattern with three sequential nodes:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ReadResumes[Map: Read Resumese] --> EvaluateResumes[Batch: Evaluate Resumes]
    EvaluateResumes --> ReduceResults[Reduce: Aggregate Results]
```

Here's what each node does:

1. **ReadResumesNode (Map Phase)**: Reads all resume files from the data directory and stores them in the shared data store
2. **EvaluateResumesNode (Batch Processing)**: Processes each resume individually using an LLM to determine if candidates qualify
3. **ReduceResultsNode (Reduce Phase)**: Aggregates evaluation results and produces a summary of qualified candidates

## Files

- [`main.py`](./main.py): Main entry point for running the resume qualification workflow
- [`flow.py`](./flow.py): Defines the flow that connects the nodes
- [`nodes.py`](./nodes.py): Contains the node classes for each step in the workflow
- [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Utility functions including the LLM wrapper
- [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt): Lists the required dependencies
- [`data/`](./data/): Directory containing sample resume files for evaluation

## Example Output

```
Starting resume qualification processing...

===== Resume Qualification Summary =====
Total candidates evaluated: 5
Qualified candidates: 2 (40.0%)

Qualified candidates:

# PocketFlow MCP Demo

This project shows how to build an agent that performs addition using PocketFlow and Model Context Protocol (MCP). It presents a comparison between using MCP and basic function calling approaches.

This implementation is based  on the tutorial: [MCP Simply Explained: Function Calling Rebranded or Genuine Breakthrough?](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/mcp-simply-explained-function-calling)

## Features

- Mathematical operation tools through a simple terminal interface
- Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Comparison between MCP and direct function calling
- **Simple toggle** between MCP and local function calling

## How to Run

1. Set your API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   Or update it directly in `utils.py`

2. Install and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

## MCP vs Function Calling

To compare both approaches, this demo provides local function alternatives that don't require MCP:

- **Toggle with a simple flag:** Set `MCP = True` or `MCP = False` at the top of `utils.py` to switch between MCP and local implementations.
- No code changes needed! The application automatically uses either:
  - MCP server tools when `MCP = True`
  - Local function implementations when `MCP = False`

This allows you to see the difference between the two approaches while keeping the same workflow.

### Function Calling
- Functions are directly embedded in application code
- Each new tool requires modifying the application
- Tools are defined within the application itself

### MCP Approach
- Tools live in separate MCP servers
- Standard protocol for all tool interactions
- New tools can be added without changing the agent
- AI can interact with tools through a consistent interface

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    tools[GetToolsNode] -->|decide| decide[DecideToolNode]
    decide -->|execute| execute[ExecuteToolNode]
```

The agent uses PocketFlow to create a workflow where:
1. It takes user input about numbers
2. Connects to the MCP server for mathematical operations (or uses local functions based on the `MCP` flag)
3. Returns the result

# Multi-Agent Taboo Game

A PocketFlow example that demonstrates how to implement asynchronous multi-agent communication using the Taboo word guessing game.

## Features

- Implement asynchronous communication between two AI agents (Hinter and Guesser)
- Use AsyncNode for non-blocking agent interactions
- Create dynamic conversation flow through asyncio message queues
- Demonstrate complex turn-based game mechanics with LLMs
- Automatically terminate the game when the correct word is guessed

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

The workflow follows an asynchronous multi-agent communication pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    AsyncHinter[AsyncHinter Node] <--> MessageQueue{Message Queue}
    MessageQueue <--> AsyncGuesser[AsyncGuesser Node]
```

Here's what each component does:

1. **AsyncHinter Node**: Generates hints about the target word while avoiding forbidden words
2. **AsyncGuesser Node**: Makes guesses based on the hints received from the Hinter
3. **Message Queue**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between the agents

## Files

- [`main.py`](./main.py): Main entry point implementing the AsyncHinter and AsyncGuesser nodes and game flow
- [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Utility functions including LLM wrappers for generating hints and guesses
- [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt): Lists the required dependencies

## Example Output

```
=========== Taboo Game Starting! ===========
Target word: nostalgic
Forbidden words: ['memory', 'past', 'remember', 'feeling', 'longing']
============================================

Hinter: Here's your hint - Sentiment for earlier times.
Guesser: I guess it's - Nostalgia

Hinter: Here's your hint - Sentiment for earlier times.
Guesser: I guess it's - Reminiscence

Hinter: Here's your hint - Yearning for days gone by.
Guesser: I guess it's - Sentimentality

Hinter: Here's your hint - Reliving cherished moments or experiences.
Guesser: I guess it's - Memories

Hinter: Here's your hint - Recollection of cherished experiences.
Guesser: I guess it's - Reflection

Hinter: Here's your hint - Yearning for earlier times.
Guesser: I guess it's - Longing

Hinter: Here's your hint - Sentiment for earlier times.
Guesser: I guess it's - Nostalgic
Game Over - Correct guess!

# PocketFlow Nested BatchFlow Example

This example demonstrates Nested BatchFlow using a simple school grades calculator.

## What this Example Does

Calculates average grades for:
1. Each student in a class
2. Each class in the school

## Structure
```
school/
├── class_a/
│   ├── student1.txt  (grades: 7.5, 8.0, 9.0)
│   └── student2.txt  (grades: 8.5, 7.0, 9.5)
└── class_b/
    ├── student3.txt  (grades: 6.5, 8.5, 7.0)
    └── student4.txt  (grades: 9.0, 9.5, 8.0)
```

## How it Works

1. **Outer BatchFlow (SchoolBatchFlow)**
   - Processes each class folder
   - Returns parameters like: `{"class": "class_a"}`

2. **Inner BatchFlow (ClassBatchFlow)**
   - Processes each student file in a class
   - Returns parameters like: `{"student": "student1.txt"}`

3. **Base Flow**
   - Loads student grades
   - Calculates average
   - Saves result

## Running the Example

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Expected Output

```
Processing class_a...
- student1: Average = 8.2
- student2: Average = 8.3
Class A Average: 8.25

Processing class_b...
- student3: Average = 7.3
- student4: Average = 8.8
Class B Average: 8.05

School Average: 8.15
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Nested BatchFlow**: One BatchFlow inside another
2. **Parameter Inheritance**: Inner flow gets parameters from outer flow
3. **Hierarchical Processing**: Process data in a tree-like structure

# PocketFlow Summarize

A practical example demonstrating how to use PocketFlow to build a robust text summarization tool with error handling and retries. This example showcases core PocketFlow concepts in a real-world application.

## Features

- Text summarization using LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Automatic retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts) on API failures
- Graceful error handling with fallback responses
- Clean separation of concerns using PocketFlow's Node architecture

## Project Structure

```
.
├── docs/          # Documentation files
├── utils/         # Utility functions (LLM API wrapper)
├── flow.py        # PocketFlow implementation with Summarize Node
├── main.py        # Main application entry point
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## Implementation Details

The example implements a simple but robust text summarization workflow:

1. **Summarize Node** (`flow.py`):
   - `prep()`: Retrieves text from the shared store
   - `exec()`: Calls LLM to summarize text in 10 words
   - `exec_fallback()`: Provides graceful error handling
   - `post()`: Stores the summary back in shared store

2. **Flow Structure**:
   - Single node flow for demonstration
   - Configured with 3 retries for reliability
   - Uses shared store for data passing

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your environment:
   - Set up your LLM API key (check utils/call_llm.py for configuration)

4. Run the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Usage

The example comes with a sample text about PocketFlow, but you can modify `main.py` to summarize your own text:

```python
shared = {"data": "Your text to summarize here..."}
flow.run(shared)
print("Summary:", shared["summary"])
```

## What You'll Learn

This example demonstrates several key PocketFlow concepts:

- **Node Architecture**: How to structure LLM tasks using prep/exec/post pattern
- **Error Handling**: Implementing retry mechanisms and fallbacks
- **Shared Store**: Using shared storage for data flow between steps
- **Flow Creation**: Setting up a basic PocketFlow workflow

# Parallel Batch Translation Process

This project demonstrates using PocketFlow's async and parallel features (`AsyncFlow`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`) to translate a document into multiple languages concurrently.

- Check out the [Substack Post Tutorial](https://pocketflow.substack.com/p/parallel-llm-calls-from-scratch-tutorial) for more!

## Goal

Translate `../../README.md` into multiple languages (Chinese, Spanish, etc.) in parallel, saving each to a file in the `translations/` directory. The main goal is to compare execution time against a sequential process.

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set API Key:
   Set the environment variable for your Anthropic API key.
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   *(Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with your actual key)*
   *(Alternatively, place `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here` in a `.env` file)*

3. Verify API Key (Optional):
   Run a quick check using the utility script.
   ```bash
   python utils.py
   ```
   *(Note: This requires a valid API key to be set.)*

4. Run the translation process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

The implementation uses an `AsyncParallelBatchNode` that processes translation requests concurrently. The `TranslateTextNodeParallel`:

1. Prepares batches, pairing the source text with each target language.

2. Executes translation calls to the LLM for all languages concurrently using `async` operations.

3. Saves the translated content to individual files (`translations/README_LANGUAGE.md`).

This approach leverages `asyncio` and parallel execution to speed up I/O-bound tasks like multiple API calls.

## Example Output & Comparison

Running this parallel version significantly reduces the total time compared to a sequential approach:

```
# --- Sequential Run Output (from pocketflow-batch) ---
Starting sequential translation into 8 languages...
Translated Chinese text
...
Translated Korean text
Saved translation to translations/README_CHINESE.md
...
Saved translation to translations/README_KOREAN.md

Total sequential translation time: ~1136 seconds

=== Translation Complete ===
Translations saved to: translations
============================


# --- Parallel Run Output (this example) ---
Starting parallel translation into 8 languages...
Translated French text
Translated Portuguese text
... # Messages may appear interleaved
Translated Spanish text
Saved translation to translations/README_CHINESE.md
...
Saved translation to translations/README_KOREAN.md

Total parallel translation time: ~209 seconds

=== Translation Complete ===

```
*(Actual times will vary based on API response speed and system.)*

# Parallel Image Processor

Demonstrates how AsyncParallelBatchFlow processes multiple images with multiple filters >8x faster than sequential processing.

## Features

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      subgraph AsyncParallelBatchFlow[Image Processing Flow]
          subgraph AsyncFlow[Per Image-Filter Flow]
              A[Load Image] --> B[Apply Filter]
              B --> C[Save Image]
          end
      end
  ```
  
- Processes images with multiple filters in parallel
- Applies three different filters (grayscale, blur, sepia)
- Shows significant speed improvement over sequential processing
- Manages system resources with semaphores

## Run It

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Output

```=== Processing Images in Parallel ===
Parallel Image Processor
------------------------------
Found 3 images:
- images/bird.jpg
- images/cat.jpg
- images/dog.jpg

Running sequential batch flow...
Processing 3 images with 3 filters...
Total combinations: 9
Loading image: images/bird.jpg
Applying grayscale filter...
Saved: output/bird_grayscale.jpg
...etc

Timing Results:
Sequential batch processing: 13.76 seconds
Parallel batch processing: 1.71 seconds
Speedup: 8.04x

Processing complete! Check the output/ directory for results.
```

## Key Points

- **Sequential**: Total time = sum of all item times
  - Good for: Rate-limited APIs, maintaining order

- **Parallel**: Total time ≈ longest single item time
  - Good for: I/O-bound tasks, independent operations

# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project demonstrates a simplified RAG system that retrieves relevant documents based on user queries and generates answers using an LLM. This implementation is based directly on the tutorial: [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) from Scratch — Tutorial For Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag).


## Features

- Document chunking for processing long texts
- FAISS-powered vector-based document retrieval
- LLM-powered answer generation

## How to Run

1. Set your API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   Or update it directly in `utils.py`

   Let's do a quick check to make sure your API key is working properly:

   ```bash
   python utils.py
   ```

2. Install and run with the default query:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

3. Run the application with a sample query:

   ```bash
   python main.py --"How does the Q-Mesh protocol achieve high transaction speeds?"
   ```

## How It Works

The magic happens through a two-phase pipeline implemented with PocketFlow:

```

Here's what each part does:
1. **ChunkDocumentsNode**: Breaks documents into smaller chunks for better retrieval
2. **EmbedDocumentsNode**: Converts document chunks into vector representations
3. **CreateIndexNode**: Creates a searchable FAISS index from embeddings
4. **EmbedQueryNode**: Converts user query into the same vector space
5. **RetrieveDocumentNode**: Finds the most similar document using vector search
6. **GenerateAnswerNode**: Uses an LLM to generate an answer based on the retrieved content

## Example Output

```

# PocketFlow Streamlit Image Generation HITL

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) image generation application using PocketFlow and Streamlit. Enter text prompts, generate images with OpenAI, and approve/regenerate results.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="./assets/banner.png" width="800"
  />
</p>

## Features

-   **Image Generation:** Uses OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` model to generate images from text prompts
-   **Human Review:** Interactive interface to approve or regenerate images
-   **State Machine:** Clean state-based workflow (`initial_input` → `user_feedback` → `final`)
-   **PocketFlow Integration:** Uses PocketFlow `Node` and `Flow` for image generation with built-in retries
-   **Session State Management:** Streamlit session state acts as PocketFlow's shared store
-   **In-Memory Images:** Images stored as base64 strings, no disk storage required

## How to Run

1.  **Set OpenAI API Key:**
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4.  **Access the Web UI:**
    Open the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

1. **Enter Prompt**: Describe the image you want to generate
2. **Generate**: Click "Generate Image" to create the image
3. **Review**: View the generated image and choose:
   - **Approve**: Accept the image and move to final result
   - **Regenerate**: Generate a new image with the same prompt
4. **Final**: View approved image and optionally start over

# Design Doc: PocketFlow Streamlit Image Generation HITL

> Human-in-the-Loop image generation application using PocketFlow and Streamlit

## Requirements

**User Story**: As a user, I want to:
1. Enter a text prompt describing an image I want to generate
2. Have the system generate an image based on my prompt using OpenAI's image generation API
3. Review the generated image in the web interface
4. Approve the image if I'm satisfied, OR regenerate with the same prompt if I want a different result
5. See the final approved image as the completed result

**Technical Requirements**:
- Use OpenAI's image generation API (via responses.create with image_generation tool)
- Keep generated images in memory (base64 format) - no disk storage
- Provide clear approve/regenerate workflow
- Handle API errors gracefully with retries
- Maintain session state between generations

## Flow Design

### Applicable Design Pattern:

**State Machine with Multiple Subflows**: Each state has its own user interface and workflow. Users interact with different UI elements in each state, and the app transitions to the next state based on user actions and feedback.

### States & User Interface:

1. **initial_input** - User sees text input field, enters prompt, clicks "Generate Image" button
2. **user_feedback** - User sees generated image, has "Approve" and "Regenerate" buttons 
3. **final** - User sees final approved image and "Start Over" button

### Flow High-level Design & Transitions:

```mermaid

    UF -->|Regenerate| GI

```

**Legend:**

   - *Output*: base64 image data (str)
   - *Purpose*: Calls OpenAI's image generation API and returns base64 encoded image
   - *Error Handling*: Includes retry logic for API failures

## Node Design

### Shared Memory

**Using Streamlit Session State as Shared Store**: We use `st.session_state` directly as the shared store for PocketFlow, eliminating the need for separate data structures.

The session state structure for the image generation workflow:

```python
st.session_state = {
    # User input and workflow state
    "task_input": "user's text prompt for image generation",
    "stage": "current workflow stage (initial_input/user_feedback/final)",
    "error_message": "any error messages for user feedback",
    
    # Processing data
    "input_used_by_process": "prompt used for generation",
    "generated_image": "base64 encoded image data",
    "final_result": "final approved image data",
    
    # Streamlit built-in keys (managed automatically)
    # "_streamlit_*": various internal streamlit state
}
```

### Node Steps

**Initial Input Flow Nodes:**

1. **Image Generation Node**
   - *Purpose*: Generate image using OpenAI API based on the prompt
   - *Type*: Regular (with retries for API reliability)
   - *Steps*:
     - *prep*: Read "input_used_by_process" from st.session_state
     - *exec*: Call generate_image utility with the prompt, return base64 image data
     - *post*: Write base64 image data to "generated_image" in st.session_state

**User Feedback Flow:**
- Reuses the same `GenerateImage` node when user clicks "Regenerate"

**Final Flow:**
- No processing nodes needed - the `final` state simply displays the approved image from `generated_image` and provides UI for starting over

# Structured Output Demo

A minimal demo application showing how to use PocketFlow to extract structured data from a resume using direct prompting and YAML formatting. Why YAML? Check out the [doc](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/structure.html).

This implementation is based on: [Structured Output for Beginners: 3 Must-Know Prompting Tips](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/structured-output-for-beginners-3).

## Features

- Extracts structured data using prompt engineering
- Validates output structure before processing

## Run It

1. Install the packages you need with this simple command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Make sure your OpenAI API key is set:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can edit the [`utils.py`](./utils.py) file to include your API key directly.

    Let's do a quick check to make sure your API key is working properly:

    ```bash
    python utils.py
    ```

3. Edit [data.txt](./data.txt) with the resume you want to parse (a sample resume is already included)

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    parser[ResumeParserNode]
```

The Resume Parser application uses a single node that:
1. Takes resume text from the shared state (loaded from data.txt)
2. Sends the resume to an LLM with a prompt that requests YAML formatted output
3. Extracts and validates the structured YAML data
4. Outputs the structured result

# Research Supervisor

This project demonstrates a supervisor that oversees an unreliable [research agent](../pocketflow-agent) to ensure high-quality answers.

## Features

- Evaluates responses for quality and relevance
- Rejects nonsensical or unreliable answers
- Requests new answers until a quality response is produced

## Getting Started

1. Install the packages you need with this simple command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Let's get your OpenAI API key ready:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

3. Let's do a quick check to make sure your API key is working properly:

```bash
python utils.py
```

This will test both the LLM call and web search features. If you see responses, you're good to go!

4. Try out the agent with the default question (about Nobel Prize winners):

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Got a burning question? Ask anything you want by using the `--` prefix:

```bash
python main.py --"What is quantum computing?"
```

## How It Works?

The magic happens through a simple but powerful graph structure with these main components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph InnerAgent[Inner Research Agent]
        DecideAction -->|"search"| SearchWeb
        DecideAction -->|"answer"| UnreliableAnswerNode
        SearchWeb -->|"decide"| DecideAction
    end
    
    InnerAgent --> SupervisorNode
    SupervisorNode -->|"retry"| InnerAgent
```

Here's what each part does:
1. **DecideAction**: The brain that figures out whether to search or answer based on current context
2. **SearchWeb**: The researcher that goes out and finds information using web search
3. **UnreliableAnswerNode**: Generates answers (with a 50% chance of being unreliable)
4. **SupervisorNode**: Quality control that validates answers and rejects nonsensical ones

## Example Output

```

# PocketFlow TAO (Thought-Action-Observation)

A powerful pattern that enables AI agents to solve complex problems through structured thinking, action execution, and result observation. This example demonstrates how to implement the TAO pattern using PocketFlow.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── flow.py        # PocketFlow implementation of TAO pattern
├── main.py        # Main application entry point
├── nodes.py       # TAO node definitions
├── requirements.txt # Project dependencies
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## Overview

The TAO pattern consists of three key steps:
1. **Thought**: The agent deeply analyzes the problem and forms a solution strategy
2. **Action**: Concrete actions are executed based on the thinking
3. **Observation**: Results are evaluated and feedback is gathered

This cycle continues until the problem is solved or termination conditions are met.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set API key (if using specific LLM services):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# Or set in code
```

## How to Run

Execute the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

The TAO pattern is implemented as a flow in PocketFlow, with each step handled by specialized nodes:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Problem[Problem Input] --> ThoughtNode
    ThoughtNode[Thought Node] --> ActionNode[Action Node]
    ActionNode --> ObservationNode[Observation Node]
    ObservationNode --> DecisionNode{Problem Solved?}
    DecisionNode -->|Yes| Solution[Solution]
    DecisionNode -->|No| ThoughtNode
```

Each TAO cycle generates new insights for the problem-solving process, allowing the AI to iteratively approach an optimal solution.

## Use Cases

- Complex problem solving
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Projects requiring iterative improvement
- Reinforcement learning-style AI applications

## Example Output

```
Query: I need to understand the latest developments in artificial intelligence

🤔 Thought 1: Decided to execute search
🚀 Executing action: search, input: latest developments in artificial intelligence 2023
✅ Action completed, result obtained
👁️ Observation: The search result indicates that information was r...
🎯 Final Answer: As of October 2023, some of the latest developments in artificial intelligence include advances in large language models like GPT-4, increased focus on AI alignment and safety, improvements in reinforcement learning, and the integration of AI into more industries such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. Researchers are also exploring ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible AI deployment. For the most current updates beyond this date, I recommend checking recent publications, official AI research organization releases, or news sources specializing in technology.

Flow ended, thank you for using!

Final Answer:
As of October 2023, some of the latest developments in artificial intelligence include advances in large language models like GPT-4, increased focus on AI alignment and safety, improvements in reinforcement learning, and the integration of AI into more industries such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. Researchers are also exploring ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible AI deployment. For the most current updates beyond this date, I recommend checking recent publications, official AI research organization releases, or news sources specializing in technology.
```

## Advanced Usage

The TAO pattern can be extended by:
- Adding memory components to store past thoughts and observations.
- Implementing adaptive action selection strategies.
- Integrating external tools and APIs.
- Adding human feedback loops.
- Adding max attempt to control the iteration.

# Text-to-SQL Workflow

A PocketFlow example demonstrating a text-to-SQL workflow that converts natural language questions into executable SQL queries for an SQLite database, including an LLM-powered debugging loop for failed queries.

- Check out the [Substack Post Tutorial](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/text-to-sql-from-scratch-tutorial) for more!

## Features

-   **Schema Awareness**: Automatically retrieves the database schema to provide context to the LLM.
-   **LLM-Powered SQL Generation**: Uses an LLM (GPT-4o) to translate natural language questions into SQLite queries (using YAML structured output).
-   **Automated Debugging Loop**: If SQL execution fails, an LLM attempts to correct the query based on the error message. This process repeats up to a configurable number of times.
## Getting Started

1.  **Install Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set API Key:**
    Set the environment variable for your OpenAI API key.
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    *(Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with your actual key)*

3.  **Verify API Key (Optional):**
    Run a quick check using the utility script. If successful, it will print a short joke.
    ```bash
    python utils.py
    ```
    *(Note: This requires a valid API key to be set.)*

4.  **Run Default Example:**
    Execute the main script. This will create the sample `ecommerce.db` if it doesn't exist and run the workflow with a default query.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The default query is:
    > Show me the names and email addresses of customers from New York

5.  **Run Custom Query:**
    Provide your own natural language query as command-line arguments after the script name.
    ```bash
    python main.py What is the total stock quantity for products in the 'Accessories' category?
    ```
    Or, for queries with spaces, ensure they are treated as a single argument by the shell if necessary (quotes might help depending on your shell):
    ```bash
    python main.py "List orders placed in the last 30 days with status 'shipped'"
    ```

## How It Works

The workflow uses several nodes connected in a sequence, with a loop for debugging failed SQL queries.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Get Schema] --> B[Generate SQL]
    B --> C[Execute SQL]
    C -- Success --> E[End]
    C -- SQLite Error --> D{Debug SQL Attempt}
    D -- Corrected SQL --> C
    C -- Max Retries Reached --> F[End with Error]

    style E fill:#dff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

```

**Node Descriptions:**

1.  **`GetSchema`**: Connects to the SQLite database (`ecommerce.db` by default) and extracts the schema (table names and columns).
2.  **`GenerateSQL`**: Takes the natural language query and the database schema, prompts the LLM to generate an SQLite query (expecting YAML output with the SQL), and parses the result.
3.  **`ExecuteSQL`**: Attempts to run the generated SQL against the database.
    *   If successful, the results are stored, and the flow ends successfully.
    *   If an `sqlite3.Error` occurs (e.g., syntax error), it captures the error message and triggers the debug loop.
4.  **`DebugSQL`**: If `ExecuteSQL` failed, this node takes the original query, schema, failed SQL, and error message, prompts the LLM to generate a *corrected* SQL query (again, expecting YAML).
5.  **(Loop)**: The corrected SQL from `DebugSQL` is passed back to `ExecuteSQL` for another attempt.
6.  **(End Conditions)**: The loop continues until `ExecuteSQL` succeeds or the maximum number of debug attempts (default: 3) is reached.

## Files

-   [`main.py`](./main.py): Main entry point to run the workflow. Handles command-line arguments for the query.
-   [`flow.py`](./flow.py): Defines the PocketFlow `Flow` connecting the different nodes, including the debug loop logic.
-   [`nodes.py`](./nodes.py): Contains the `Node` classes for each step (`GetSchema`, `GenerateSQL`, `ExecuteSQL`, `DebugSQL`).
-   [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Contains the minimal `call_llm` utility function.
-   [`populate_db.py`](./populate_db.py): Script to create and populate the sample `ecommerce.db` SQLite database.

# Design Doc: Text-to-SQL Agent

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

The system should take a natural language query and a path to an SQLite database as input. It should then:
1.  Extract the schema from the database.
2.  Generate an SQL query based on the natural language query and the schema.
3.  Execute the SQL query against the database.
4.  If the SQL execution fails, attempt to debug and retry the SQL generation and execution up to a specified maximum number of attempts.
5.  Return the final results of the SQL query or an error message if the process fails.

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

The primary design pattern is a **Workflow** with an embedded **Agent**-like behavior for debugging.
-   **Workflow**: The process follows a sequence: Get Schema -> Generate SQL -> Execute SQL.
-   **Agent (for Debugging)**: If `ExecuteSQL` fails, the `DebugSQL` node acts like an agent, taking the error and previous SQL as context to generate a revised SQL query. This forms a loop back to `ExecuteSQL`.

### Flow high-level Design:

1.  **`GetSchema`**: Retrieves the database schema.
2.  **`GenerateSQL`**: Generates an SQL query from a natural language question and the schema.
3.  **`ExecuteSQL`**: Executes the generated SQL. If successful, the flow ends. If an error occurs, it transitions to `DebugSQL`.
4.  **`DebugSQL`**: Attempts to correct the failed SQL query based on the error message. It then transitions back to `ExecuteSQL` to try the corrected query.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[GetSchema] --> B[GenerateSQL]
    B --> C{ExecuteSQL}
    C -- Success --> D[End]
    C -- Error --> E[DebugSQL]
    E --> C
```

## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1.  **Call LLM** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
    *   *Input*: `prompt` (str)
    *   *Output*: `response` (str)
    *   *Necessity*: Used by `GenerateSQL` and `DebugSQL` nodes to interact with the language model for SQL generation and correction.

*Database interaction (e.g., `sqlite3.connect`, `cursor.execute`) is handled directly within the nodes and is not abstracted into separate utility functions in this implementation.*

## Node Design

### Shared Store

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared store structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "db_path": "path/to/database.db",       # Input: Path to the SQLite database
    "natural_query": "User's question",      # Input: Natural language query from the user
    "max_debug_attempts": 3,                # Input: Max retries for the debug loop
    "schema": None,                         # Output of GetSchema: String representation of DB schema
    "generated_sql": None,                  # Output of GenerateSQL/DebugSQL: The SQL query string
    "execution_error": None,                # Output of ExecuteSQL (on failure): Error message
    "debug_attempts": 0,                    # Internal: Counter for debug attempts

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1.  **`GetSchema`**
    *   *Purpose*: To extract and store the schema of the target SQLite database.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   *`prep`*: Reads `db_path` from the shared store.
        *   *`exec`*: Connects to the SQLite database, inspects `sqlite_master` and `PRAGMA table_info` to build a string representation of all tables and their columns.
        *   *`post`*: Writes the extracted `schema` string to the shared store.

2.  **`GenerateSQL`**
    *   *Purpose*: To generate an SQL query based on the user's natural language query and the database schema.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   *`prep`*: Reads `natural_query` and `schema` from the shared store.
        *   *`exec`*: Constructs a prompt for the LLM, including the schema and the natural language query, asking for an SQL query in YAML format. Calls the `call_llm` utility. Parses the YAML response to extract the SQL query.
        *   *`post`*: Writes the `generated_sql` to the shared store. Resets `debug_attempts` to 0.

3.  **`ExecuteSQL`**
    *   *Purpose*: To execute the generated SQL query against the database and handle results or errors.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   *`prep`*: Reads `db_path` and `generated_sql` from the shared store.
        *   *`exec`*: Connects to the SQLite database and executes the `generated_sql`. It determines if the query is a SELECT or an DML/DDL statement to fetch results or commit changes. Returns a tuple `(success_boolean, result_or_error_message, column_names_list)`.
        *   *`post`*:
            *   If successful: Stores `final_result` and `result_columns` in the shared store. Returns no action (ends the flow path).
            *   If failed: Stores `execution_error` in the shared store. Increments `debug_attempts`. If `debug_attempts` is less than `max_debug_attempts`, returns `"error_retry"` action to trigger the `DebugSQL` node. Otherwise, sets `final_error` and returns no action.

4.  **`DebugSQL`**
    *   *Purpose*: To attempt to correct a failed SQL query using LLM based on the error message.
    *   *Type*: Regular
    *   *Steps*:
        *   *`prep`*: Reads `natural_query`, `schema`, `generated_sql` (the failed one), and `execution_error` from the shared store.
        *   *`exec`*: Constructs a prompt for the LLM, providing the failed SQL, the original query, the schema, and the error message, asking for a corrected SQL query in YAML format. Calls the `call_llm` utility. Parses the YAML response to extract the corrected SQL query.
        *   *`post`*: Overwrites `generated_sql` in the shared store with the corrected SQL. Removes `execution_error` from the shared store. Returns a default action to go back to `ExecuteSQL`.

# Chain-of-Thought

This project demonstrates an implementation that orchestrates a Chain-of-Thought process, enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning problems by thinking step-by-step. It's designed to improve problem-solving accuracy through deliberate, structured reasoning managed externally.

This implementation is based on: [Build Chain-of-Thought From Scratch - Tutorial for Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/build-chain-of-thought-from-scratch).

## Features

- Improves model reasoning on complex problems.
- Leverages capable instruction-following models (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4 series) to perform structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
- Solves problems that direct prompting often fails on by breaking them down systematically.
- Provides detailed reasoning traces, including step-by-step evaluation and planning, for verification.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set API Key:**
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

3.  **Verify API Key (Optional):**
    Run a quick check to ensure your key and environment are set up correctly.
    ```bash
    python utils.py
    ```

4.  **Run Default Example:**
    Execute the main script to see the process in action with the default Jane Street problem.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The default question is:
    > You keep rolling a fair die until you roll three, four, five in that order consecutively on three rolls. What is the probability that you roll the die an odd number of times?

5.  **Run Custom Problem:**
    Provide your own reasoning problem using the `--` argument.
    ```bash
    python main.py --"Your complex reasoning problem here"
    ```

## How It Works

The implementation uses a self-looping PocketFlow node (`ChainOfThoughtNode`) that guides an LLM through a structured problem-solving process:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    cot[ChainOfThoughtNode] -->|"continue"| cot
```

In each loop (thought step), the node directs the LLM to:
1.  Evaluate the previous thought's reasoning and results.
2.  Execute the next pending step according to a maintained plan.
3.  Update the plan, marking the step done (with results) or noting issues.
4.  Refine the plan if steps need breaking down or errors require correction.
5.  Decide if further thinking (`next_thought_needed`) is required based on the plan state.

This external orchestration enforces a systematic approach, helping models tackle problems that are difficult with a single prompt.

## Comparison with Different Approaches

-   **Standard Prompting**: Techniques like asking the model to "think step by step" within a single prompt can help, but the reasoning might lack depth or structure, and the model can easily lose track or make unrecoverable errors.
-   **Native Extended Thinking Modes**: Some models (like Claude 3.7, GPT-o1, etc.) offer dedicated modes or features explicitly for extended reasoning, often yielding strong results directly via API calls.
-   **This Implementation**: Demonstrates how to orchestrate a structured Chain-of-Thought process using standard LLMs (even those without a specific native 'extended thinking' mode), managing the steps, planning, and evaluation externally via prompt engineering and flow control.

## Example Thinking Process

Let's try out this challenging [Jane Street Quant Trading Interview Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJTkuEVPrU):

> **Problem**: You keep rolling a fair die until you roll three, four, five in that order consecutively on three rolls. What is the probability that you roll the die an odd number of times?

This problem demonstrates why structured Chain-of-Thought is valuable:

-   **Standard models (single prompt)**: Often get the wrong answer or provide flawed reasoning.
-   **Models using native thinking modes**: Can find the correct answer (216/431 ≈ 0.5012), though performance and reasoning clarity may vary.
-   **This implementation (orchestrating a capable LLM)**: Can guide the model towards the correct answer by enforcing a step-by-step plan, evaluation, and refinement loop.

For comparison:
-   [Claude 3.7 Sonnet (single prompt)](https://claude.ai/share/da139326-42fe-42d9-9d7b-35870daa5c1b): Wrong answer
-   [Claude 3.7 Sonnet (using built-in thinking)](https://claude.ai/share/6f4140ed-f33c-4949-8778-a57719498e40): Correct answer after 3m, 45s
-   [GPT-o1 (using built-in thinking)](https://chatgpt.com/share/67fee0fd-2600-8000-bcdf-76e40a986ee4): Correct answer after 2m, 0s
-   [GPT-o1 pro (using built-in thinking)](https://chatgpt.com/share/67fee11b-530c-8000-92d1-609b6ca49c9c): Correct answer after 4m, 24s

Below is an example output trace showing how **this implementation guides Claude 3.7 Sonnet** through the problem-solving process:

> **Note:** Even with structured thinking orchestration, models don't always get the right answer, especially on very complex or novel problems. However, this approach significantly improves the robustness of the reasoning process and provides a traceable path for verification and debugging.

```
🤔 Processing question: You keep rolling a fair die until you roll three, four, five in that order consecutively on three rolls. What is the probability that you roll the die an odd number of times?

Thought 1:
  Let me think through this problem by setting up a clear approach.

  We need to find the probability that the total number of die rolls will be odd, given we stop when we roll "3,4,5" consecutively in that order.

  This is a problem about a stochastic process that ends when a specific pattern occurs. To solve it, I'll:
  1. Set up a Markov chain model to track progress toward the target sequence
  2. Calculate expected lengths and probabilities for different outcomes
  3. Determine if the total number of rolls has equal probability of being odd vs. even

  First, I need to understand what states we can be in while rolling the die:
  - State 0: Haven't rolled any of the sequence yet
  - State 1: Just rolled a 3, waiting for 4
  - State 2: Rolled 3 followed by 4, waiting for 5
  - State 3: Success! Rolled the full "3,4,5" sequence

  When the die is rolled, we transition between these states with certain probabilities. Each state depends only on the previous 0-2 rolls, making this a Markov process.

Current Plan Status:
    - [Done] Understand the problem structure: Identified that we need the probability of an odd number of total rolls until getting '3,4,5' consecutively. Set up a Markov chain with states representing progress toward target sequence.
    - [Pending] Set up the Markov model with transition probabilities
      - [Pending] Define relevant states in the Markov chain
      - [Pending] Calculate transition probabilities between states
    - [Pending] Calculate generating functions for the process
    - [Pending] Determine probability of odd number of rolls
      - [Pending] Extract coefficient information from generating function
      - [Pending] Compute final probability value
    - [Pending] Verify solution with alternative approach
    - [Pending] Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------

Thought 2:
  Evaluation of Thought 1: Correct. The approach of using a Markov chain to model this problem is appropriate. Identifying the states (0: no part of sequence, 1: just rolled 3, 2: rolled 3,4, 3: success with 3,4,5) correctly captures the progression toward our target sequence.

  I'll now set up the Markov model with transition probabilities. Each state represents our progress toward the target sequence "3,4,5".

  State 0: Haven't rolled any relevant part of the sequence yet
  - If we roll a 3: Move to State 1 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll anything else: Stay in State 0 (probability 5/6)

  State 1: Just rolled a 3, waiting for a 4
  - If we roll a 4: Move to State 2 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll a 3: Stay in State 1 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll anything else: Return to State 0 (probability 4/6)

  State 2: Rolled 3 followed by 4, waiting for a 5
  - If we roll a 5: Move to State 3 (success - probability 1/6)
  - If we roll a 3: Move to State 1 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll anything else: Return to State 0 (probability 4/6)

  State 3: Success! Rolled the sequence "3,4,5"
  - This is an absorbing state; once we reach it, we stop rolling.

  These transition probabilities can be represented as a matrix:
  P = [
      [5/6, 1/6, 0,   0  ],
      [4/6, 1/6, 1/6, 0  ],
      [4/6, 1/6, 0,   1/6],
      [0,   0,   0,   1  ]
  ]

  This completes the setup of the Markov model with transition probabilities.

    - [Pending] Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------

Thought 3:
  Evaluation of Thought 2: Correct. The Markov chain setup with the four states and the transition probability matrix accurately represents our problem. Now I'll proceed to calculating the generating functions for this process.

  To calculate the generating functions, I'll use the variable z to represent a single die roll. For each state, the generating function gives us information about the number of rolls until we reach our success state.

  Let G₀(z), G₁(z), G₂(z), and G₃(z) be the generating functions for reaching the success state (State 3) when starting from State 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

  G₃(z) = 1 (since we're already in the success state)

  For the other states, we can write equations based on the first roll and subsequent state:

  G₀(z) = z·(5/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z))
  This means: we roll once (factor z), then with probability 5/6 we stay in State 0, or with probability 1/6 we move to State 1.

  G₁(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·G₂(z))
  When in State 1, we roll once (factor z), then either move to State 0, stay in State 1, or advance to State 2.

  G₂(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·G₃(z))
      = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·1)
      = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6)

  Now I can solve this system of equations for G₀(z):

  From G₀(z) = z·(5/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z)):
  G₀(z) - 5z/6·G₀(z) = z/6·G₁(z)
  G₀(z)(1 - 5z/6) = z/6·G₁(z)
  G₀(z) = (z/6·G₁(z))/(1 - 5z/6) ... (1)

  From G₁(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·G₂(z)):
  G₁(z) - z/6·G₁(z) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₂(z)
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₂(z) ... (2)

  From G₂(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6):
  G₂(z) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₁(z) + z/6 ... (3)

  Substituting (3) into (2):
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·(4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₁(z) + z/6)
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + 4z²/36·G₀(z) + z²/36·G₁(z) + z²/36
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6 - z²/36) = 4z/6·G₀(z)(1 + z/6) + z²/36
  G₁(z) = (4z/6·G₀(z)(1 + z/6) + z²/36)/(1 - z/6 - z²/36) ... (4)

  Substituting (4) into (1) gives us G₀(z) in terms of z only, which I can then simplify to find the closed form.

  This is getting algebraically intricate. Let me take a step back and consider a different approach using first-step analysis with parity.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 4:
  Evaluation of Thought 3: Correct, but pivoting is wise. The generating function approach, while theoretically sound, is becoming algebraically complex. The decision to switch to a first-step analysis with parity is appropriate for this problem.

  I'll now use first-step analysis focusing specifically on the parity of the number of rolls.

  Let's define:
  - P₀: Probability of rolling an odd number of times when starting in State 0
  - P₁: Probability of rolling an odd number of times when starting in State 1
  - P₂: Probability of rolling an odd number of times when starting in State 2

  Using first-step analysis, we can write equations for each state:

  For State 0:
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we go to State 1 with 1 roll used (odd). The total number of rolls will be odd if the remaining rolls from State 1 are even. 
  - If we roll anything else (prob 5/6), we stay in State 0 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if the remaining rolls from State 0 are even.

  Therefore: P₀ = (1/6)*(1-P₁) + (5/6)*(1-P₀) = 5/6 - 5P₀/6 + 1/6 - P₁/6

  For State 1:
  - If we roll a 4 (prob 1/6), we go to State 2 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 2 are even.
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we stay in State 1 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 1 are even.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 4/6), we go to State 0 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 0 are even.

  Therefore: P₁ = (1/6)*(1-P₂) + (1/6)*(1-P₁) + (4/6)*(1-P₀) = 1 - P₂/6 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  For State 2:
  - If we roll a 5 (prob 1/6), we're done with 1 more roll (odd). Total is definitely odd.
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we go to State 1 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 1 are even.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 4/6), we go to State 0 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 0 are even.

  Therefore: P₂ = (1/6)*1 + (1/6)*(1-P₁) + (4/6)*(1-P₀) = 1/6 + 1/6 - P₁/6 + 4/6 - 4P₀/6 = 6/6 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  Now I have a system of 3 equations with 3 unknowns:
  P₀ = 1 - 5P₀/6 - P₁/6
  P₁ = 1 - P₁/6 - P₂/6 - 4P₀/6
  P₂ = 1 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  Simplifying:
  (6/6)P₀ = 6/6 - 5P₀/6 - P₁/6
  (6/6)P₁ = 6/6 - P₁/6 - P₂/6 - 4P₀/6
  (6/6)P₂ = 6/6 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  Further simplifying:
  11P₀/6 + P₁/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + 7P₁/6 + P₂/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + P₁/6 + 6P₂/6 = 1

  This is a linear system of equations that I can solve.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 5:
  Evaluation of Thought 4: Correct. The first-step analysis with parity is well set up, with appropriate variables P₀, P₁, and P₂ representing the probability of rolling an odd number of times from each state. The system of equations is correctly derived, though I notice it's written in slightly different forms across the thought. Let me solve this system now.

  Taking the system of equations from the end of Thought 4:
  11P₀/6 + P₁/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + 7P₁/6 + P₂/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + P₁/6 + 6P₂/6 = 1

  Let's multiply all equations by 6 to eliminate fractions:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6

  Subtracting the third equation from the second:
  (4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂) - (4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂) = 6 - 6
  6P₁ - 5P₂ = 0
  6P₁ = 5P₂
  P₁ = 5P₂/6

  From the first equation:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  11P₀ + 5P₂/6 = 6
  66P₀ + 5P₂ = 36

  From the third equation:
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + 5P₂/6 + 6P₂ = 6
  24P₀ + 5P₂ + 36P₂ = 36
  24P₀ + 41P₂ = 36

  Now solving for P₀ in terms of P₂:
  24P₀ + 41P₂ = 36
  24P₀ = 36 - 41P₂
  P₀ = (36 - 41P₂)/24 = 3/2 - 41P₂/24

  Substituting back into 66P₀ + 5P₂ = 36:
  66(3/2 - 41P₂/24) + 5P₂ = 36
  99/2 - 66*41P₂/24 + 5P₂ = 36
  99/2 - 2706P₂/24 + 5P₂ = 36
  99/2 - 2706P₂/24 + 120P₂/24 = 36
  99/2 - (2706-120)P₂/24 = 36
  99/2 - 2586P₂/24 = 36
  99 - 2586P₂/12 = 72
  99 - 72 = 2586P₂/12
  27 = 2586P₂/12
  27*12 = 2586P₂
  324 = 2586P₂
  P₂ = 324/2586 = 108/862 = 54/431

  Now we can find P₁:
  P₁ = 5P₂/6 = 5(54/431)/6 = 270/2586 = 45/431

  And P₀:
  P₀ = 3/2 - 41P₂/24 = 3/2 - 41(54/431)/24 = 3/2 - 2214/10344 = 3/2 - 1107/5172

  Let's calculate: 
  P₀ = 3/2 - 1107/5172 = 7758/5172 - 1107/5172 = 6651/5172 = 2217/1724

  Now we have:
  P₀ = 2217/1724
  P₁ = 45/431
  P₂ = 54/431

  Wait, I see an error in my calculation. Let me restart with the system of equations.

  From the equations:
  11P₀/6 + P₁/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + 7P₁/6 + P₂/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + P₁/6 + 6P₂/6 = 1

  Multiplying by 6:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6

  From the first: P₁ = 6 - 11P₀

  Substituting into the second:
  4P₀ + 7(6 - 11P₀) + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + 42 - 77P₀ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ - 77P₀ + P₂ = 6 - 42
  -73P₀ + P₂ = -36
  P₂ = -36 + 73P₀

  Substituting P₁ and P₂ into the third equation:
  4P₀ + (6 - 11P₀) + 6(-36 + 73P₀) = 6
  4P₀ + 6 - 11P₀ - 216 + 438P₀ = 6
  4P₀ - 11P₀ + 438P₀ = 6 - 6 + 216
  431P₀ = 216
  P₀ = 216/431 = 8/16 = 1/2

  Now we can find:
  P₁ = 6 - 11P₀ = 6 - 11(216/431) = 6 - 2376/431 = 2586/431 - 2376/431 = 210/431
  P₂ = -36 + 73P₀ = -36 + 73(216/431) = -36 + 15768/431 = -15552/431 + 15768/431 = 216/431

  The answer to our original question is P₀, which is 216/431.

  Actually, I notice the fraction simplified to 1/2 above is incorrect (216/431 ≠ 8/16). Let's double-check with the equations:

  From 11P₀ + P₁ = 6 and P₁ = 210/431, we get:
  11(216/431) + 210/431 = 6
  2376/431 + 210/431 = 6
  2586/431 = 6
  2586 = 2586

  This confirms our answer: P₀ = 216/431, which is the probability of rolling the die an odd number of times.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 6:
  Evaluation of Thought 5: Correct. The calculation was methodical and accurate, resulting in the solution P₀ = 216/431. The self-correction when an arithmetic error was spotted was appropriate. The substitution back into the original equation verified that the answer is correct.

  Let me now verify our solution using an alternative approach. The problem asks for the probability of an odd number of rolls when stopping at the sequence "3,4,5". An alternative way to approach this is to consider the complementary probability - the probability of an even number of rolls.

  Since P₀ = 216/431 is the probability of an odd number of rolls, the probability of an even number of rolls must be 1 - 216/431 = 215/431.

  Let me verify this with the equations we derived:
  - Let Q₀, Q₁, Q₂ be the probabilities of rolling an even number of times from states 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
  - Since the events "odd number of rolls" and "even number of rolls" are complementary: Q₀ = 1-P₀, Q₁ = 1-P₁, Q₂ = 1-P₂
  - Therefore: Q₀ = 1 - 216/431 = 215/431, Q₁ = 1 - 210/431 = 221/431, Q₂ = 1 - 216/431 = 215/431

  Now, I can derive the equations for Q₀, Q₁, Q₂ directly:

  For State 0:
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we transition to State 1 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 1 are odd.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 5/6), we stay in State 0 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 0 are odd.

  Therefore: Q₀ = (1/6)(P₁) + (5/6)(P₀) = P₁/6 + 5P₀/6 = 210/431/6 + 5(216/431)/6 = 210/2586 + 1080/2586 = 1290/2586 = 215/431

  For State 1:
  - If we roll a 4 (prob 1/6), we go to State 2 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 2 are odd.
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we stay in State 1 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 1 are odd.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 4/6), we go to State 0 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 0 are odd.

  Therefore: Q₁ = (1/6)(P₂) + (1/6)(P₁) + (4/6)(P₀) = P₂/6 + P₁/6 + 4P₀/6 = 216/431/6 + 210/431/6 + 4(216/431)/6 = 216/2586 + 210/2586 + 864/2586 = 1290/2586 = 215/431

  Wait, that doesn't match our expected Q₁ = 221/431. Let me double-check...

  The direct calculation of Q₁ gives a different result than 1-P₁. This suggests an error somewhere. Let me reconsider our system:

  If P₀ + Q₀ = 1, P₁ + Q₁ = 1, P₂ + Q₂ = 1, then our system should be consistent. Let me verify our values from Thought 5:

  From 11P₀ + P₁ = 6 and P₀ = 216/431:
  11(216/431) + P₁ = 6
  2376/431 + P₁ = 6
  P₁ = 6 - 2376/431 = 2586/431 - 2376/431 = 210/431

  From 4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6:
  4(216/431) + 210/431 + 6P₂ = 6
  864/431 + 210/431 + 6P₂ = 6
  1074/431 + 6P₂ = 6
  6P₂ = 6 - 1074/431 = 2586/431 - 1074/431 = 1512/431
  P₂ = 1512/431/6 = 1512/2586 = 252/431

  This doesn't match our calculated P₂ = 216/431 from Thought 5. Let me solve the system again, more carefully.

  From the system:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6

  Subtracting the first from the third:
  (4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂) - (11P₀ + P₁) = 6 - 6
  4P₀ - 11P₀ + 6P₂ = 0
  -7P₀ + 6P₂ = 0
  6P₂ = 7P₀
  P₂ = 7P₀/6

  Subtracting the first from the second:
  (4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂) - (11P₀ + P₁) = 6 - 6
  4P₀ - 11P₀ + 6P₁ + P₂ = 0
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + P₂ = 0

  Substituting P₂ = 7P₀/6:
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + 7P₀/6 = 0
  -42P₀ + 36P₁ + 7P₀ = 0
  -35P₀ + 36P₁ = 0
  36P₁ = 35P₀
  P₁ = 35P₀/36

  Now, from the first equation:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  11P₀ + 35P₀/36 = 6
  396P₀ + 35P₀ = 216
  431P₀ = 216
  P₀ = 216/431

  Therefore:
  P₁ = 35P₀/36 = 35(216/431)/36 = 35(6)/36(431/6) = 35/6 ÷ 431/6 = 35/431
  P₂ = 7P₀/6 = 7(216/431)/6 = 7(6)/6(431/6) = 7/431/6 × 6 = 7/431 × 6 = 42/431

  Hmm, these values are different from what we calculated in Thought 5. Let me check these values in the original equations:

  11(216/431) + 35/431 = 6?
  2376/431 + 35/431 = 6?
  2411/431 = 6?
  2411 = 2586?

  This doesn't check out. Let me solve the system one more time using a different approach.

  From the original system:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6                 (1)
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6            (2)
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6            (3)

  From (3) - (1):
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ - 11P₀ - P₁ = 6 - 6
  -7P₀ + 6P₂ = 0
  6P₂ = 7P₀
  P₂ = 7P₀/6                    (4)

  From (2) - (1):
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ - 11P₀ - P₁ = 6 - 6
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + P₂ = 0

  Substituting (4):
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + 7P₀/6 = 0
  -42P₀ + 36P₁ + 7P₀ = 0
  -35P₀ + 36P₁ = 0
  36P₁ = 35P₀
  P₁ = 35P₀/36                  (5)

  Substituting (5) into (1):
  11P₀ + 35P₀/36 = 6
  (11×36)P₀ + 35P₀ = 6×36
  396P₀ + 35P₀ = 216
  431P₀ = 216
  P₀ = 216/431

  Now calculate:
  P₁ = 35P₀/36 = 35(216/431)/36 = 7560/15516 = 35/72 × 216/431 = 35×216/36×431 = 7560/15516 = 35/72 × 216/431 = 7560/15516 = 1260/2586 = 210/431

  Let me verify:
  11(216/431) + 210/431 = 6?
  2376/431 + 210/431 = 6?
  2586/431 = 6?
  2586 = 2586 ✓

  Now for P₂:
  P₂ = 7P₀/6 = 7(216/431)/6 = 1512/2586 = 252/431

  Checking:
  4(216/431) + 210/431 + 6(252/431) = 6?
  864/431 + 210/431 + 1512/431 = 6?
  2586/431 = 6?
  2586 = 2586 ✓

  Our final answer is: P₀ = 216/431, P₁ = 210/431, P₂ = 252/431

  This confirms our result that the probability of rolling an odd number of times is 216/431 ≈ 0.5012.

    - [Pending] Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------

Thought 7 (Conclusion):
  Evaluation of Thought 6: Correct. The analysis carefully re-solved the system of equations to verify our answer and found P₀ = 216/431, P₁ = 210/431, and P₂ = 252/431. The verification process was thorough, checking the solution by substituting back into the original equations, confirming that the probability of rolling an odd number of times is 216/431 ≈ 0.5012.

  Now I'll provide a conclusion that summarizes the problem, our approach, and the final answer.

  We set out to find the probability that we roll a fair die an odd number of times until getting the sequence "3,4,5" consecutively in that order.

  Our approach used a Markov chain model with states representing progress toward the target sequence:
  - State 0: Haven't rolled any part of the sequence yet
  - State 1: Just rolled a 3, waiting for 4
  - State 2: Rolled 3 followed by 4, waiting for 5
  - State 3: Success! Rolled the full "3,4,5" sequence

  Initially, we considered a generating function approach, but pivoted to a more direct first-step analysis with parity. We defined variables P₀, P₁, and P₂ representing the probabilities of an odd number of total rolls when starting from each respective state.

  Through careful derivation and solution of a system of linear equations, we found:
  P₀ = 216/431 ≈ 0.5012
  P₁ = 210/431 ≈ 0.4872
  P₂ = 252/431 ≈ 0.5847

  Since we start from State 0 (no part of the sequence rolled yet), the answer to our original question is P₀ = 216/431. 

  To verify this result, we solved the system multiple times and checked that our values satisfied the original equations.

  The final answer is: The probability of rolling the die an odd number of times until getting the sequence "3,4,5" is 216/431 ≈ 0.5012.

  This probability is slightly greater than 1/2, meaning it's slightly more likely to roll an odd number of times than an even number of times before completing the sequence.

# Chain of Thought Node Design

## 1. Requirements
Create a self-looping Chain of Thought node that can:
- Solve a problem step-by-step by maintaining and executing a structured plan.
- Critically evaluate the previous step's reasoning and results before proceeding.
- Refine the plan by breaking down complex steps into nested sub-steps.
- Update the status of plan steps (`Pending`, `Done`, `Verification Needed`) and record concise results.
- Handle potential errors identified during evaluation by adjusting the plan.
- Provide a detailed trace of the thinking process and plan evolution.
- Generate a final conclusion summarizing the solution when the plan is complete.

## 2. Flow Design
This will be a simple flow with a single node that can call itself repeatedly based on whether more thinking is needed according to the plan:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    cot[ChainOfThoughtNode] -->|"continue"| cot
```

## 3. Utilities
We'll need one primary utility function:
- `call_llm`: Call the LLM to generate the next thought (including evaluation, thinking, and updated plan) based on the problem, previous thoughts, and the current plan state. Helper functions (`format_plan`, `format_plan_for_prompt`) assist in presenting the plan.

## 4. Node Design
### Shared Store Design
```python
shared = {
    "problem": str,             # The problem statement.
    "thoughts": list[dict],     # List of thought dictionaries generated so far.
    "current_thought_number": int, # Counter for the current thought being generated.
    "solution": str | None    # Stores the final conclusion text when finished.
}
```

Each thought dictionary added to the `shared["thoughts"]` list will contain the structured output from the LLM's execution step, plus the thought number:
```python
{
    "thought_number": int,      # The sequence number of this thought.
    "current_thinking": str,    # Detailed text of the evaluation and thinking for this step.
    "planning": list[dict],     # The updated plan structure (list of dictionaries).
    "next_thought_needed": bool # Flag indicating if the loop should continue.
}
```

The `planning` list contains dictionaries representing steps, which can be nested:
```python
# Example structure for a plan step dictionary
{
    "description": str,                     # Description of the step.
    "status": str,                          # "Pending", "Done", "Verification Needed".
    "result": str | None,                   # Optional: Concise result when status is "Done".
    "mark": str | None,                     # Optional: Reason for "Verification Needed".
    "sub_steps": list[dict] | None          # Optional: Nested list for sub-steps.
}
```

### Chain of Thought Node (`ChainOfThoughtNode`)
-   **`type`**: Regular (self-looping node).
-   **`prep`**:
    -   Reads the problem statement and the list of previous thoughts from the shared store.
    -   Formats the history of thoughts and the *last known plan structure* into a text representation suitable for the LLM prompt.
    -   Determines if this is the first thought to adjust prompt instructions.
    -   Increments and updates `shared["current_thought_number"]`.
-   **`exec`**:
    -   Constructs a detailed prompt for the LLM, including:
        -   The problem statement.
        -   The formatted history of previous thoughts and plans.
        -   Specific instructions for evaluating the previous thought, executing the next pending step, updating the plan structure (using the dictionary format), handling sub-steps, managing statuses/results, and indicating completion.
        -   The required YAML output format (`current_thinking`, `planning`, `next_thought_needed`).
    -   Calls the `call_llm` utility with the prompt.
    -   Parses the LLM's YAML response.
    -   Validates the presence and basic types of required keys (`current_thinking`, `planning`, `next_thought_needed`) using `assert`.
    -   Adds the `thought_number` to the parsed data.
-   **`post`**:
    -   Appends the result dictionary from `exec` to the `shared["thoughts"]` list.
    -   Checks the `next_thought_needed` flag from the execution result.
    -   If `False`:
        -   Extracts the `current_thinking` content as the final `shared["solution"]`.
        -   Prints the final thought, plan, and solution.
        -   Returns `"end"` to terminate the flow loop.
    -   If `True`:
        -   Prints the current thought number, thinking content, and formatted current plan status.
        -   Returns `"continue"` to trigger the next iteration of the node.

            Instructions:
            1.  **Evaluate Previous Thought:** If not the first thought, start `current_thinking` by evaluating Thought {current_thought_number - 1}. State: "Evaluation of Thought {current_thought_number - 1}: [Correct/Minor Issues/Major Error - explain]". Address errors first.
            2.  **Execute Step:** Execute the first step in the plan with `status: Pending`.
            3.  **Maintain Plan (Structure):** Generate an updated `planning` list. Each item should be a dictionary with keys: `description` (string), `status` (string: "Pending", "Done", "Verification Needed"), and optionally `result` (string, concise summary when Done) or `mark` (string, reason for Verification Needed). Sub-steps are represented by a `sub_steps` key containing a *list* of these dictionaries.
            4.  **Update Current Step Status:** In the updated plan, change the `status` of the executed step to "Done" and add a `result` key with a concise summary. If verification is needed based on evaluation, change status to "Verification Needed" and add a `mark`.
            5.  **Refine Plan (Sub-steps):** If a "Pending" step is complex, add a `sub_steps` key to its dictionary containing a list of new step dictionaries (status: "Pending") breaking it down. Keep the parent step's status "Pending" until all sub-steps are "Done".
            6.  **Refine Plan (Errors):** Modify the plan logically based on evaluation findings (e.g., change status, add correction steps).
            7.  **Final Step:** Ensure the plan progresses towards a final step dictionary like `{{'description': "Conclusion", 'status': "Pending"}}`.
            8.  **Termination:** Set `next_thought_needed` to `false` ONLY when executing the step with `description: "Conclusion"`.

# Web Crawler with Content Analysis

A web crawler tool built with PocketFlow that crawls websites and analyzes content using LLM.

## Features

- Crawls websites while respecting domain boundaries
- Extracts text content and links from pages
- Analyzes content using GPT-4 to generate:
  - Page summaries
  - Main topics/keywords
  - Content type classification
- Processes pages in batches for efficiency
- Generates a comprehensive analysis report

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

## Usage

Run the crawler:
```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to:
1. Enter the website URL to crawl
2. Specify maximum number of pages to crawl (default: 10)

The tool will then:
1. Crawl the specified website
2. Extract and analyze content using GPT-4
3. Generate a report with findings

## Project Structure

# SQLite Database with PocketFlow

This example demonstrates how to properly integrate SQLite database operations with PocketFlow, focusing on:

1. Clean code organization with separation of concerns:
   - Tools layer for database operations (`tools/database.py`)
   - Node implementation for PocketFlow integration (`nodes.py`)
   - Flow configuration (`flow.py`)
   - Safe SQL query execution with parameter binding

2. Best practices for database operations:
   - Connection management with proper closing
   - SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
   - Error handling and resource cleanup
   - Simple schema management

3. Example task management system:
   - Database initialization
   - Task creation
   - Task listing
   - Status tracking

## Project Structure

```
pocketflow-tool-database/
├── tools/
│   └── database.py    # SQLite database operations
├── nodes.py          # PocketFlow node implementation
├── flow.py          # Flow configuration
└── main.py          # Example usage
```

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Initialize a SQLite database with a tasks table
2. Create an example task
3. List all tasks in the database
4. Display the results

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Database Operations**
   - Safe connection handling
   - Query parameterization
   - Schema management

2. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between database operations and PocketFlow components
   - Modular project structure
   - Type hints and documentation

3. **PocketFlow Integration**
   - Node implementation with prep->exec->post lifecycle
   - Flow configuration
   - Shared store usage for data passing

## Example Output

```
Database Status: Database initialized
Task Status: Task created successfully

All Tasks:
- ID: 1
  Title: Example Task
  Description: This is an example task created using PocketFlow
  Status: pending
  Created: 2024-03-02 12:34:56

# OpenAI Embeddings with PocketFlow

This example demonstrates how to properly integrate OpenAI's text embeddings API with PocketFlow, focusing on:

1. Clean code organization with separation of concerns:
   - Tools layer for API interactions (`tools/embeddings.py`)
   - Node implementation for PocketFlow integration (`nodes.py`)
   - Flow configuration (`flow.py`)
   - Centralized environment configuration (`utils/call_llm.py`)

2. Best practices for API key management:
   - Using environment variables
   - Supporting both `.env` files and system environment variables
   - Secure configuration handling

3. Proper project structure:
   - Modular code organization
   - Clear separation between tools and PocketFlow components
   - Reusable OpenAI client configuration

## Project Structure

```
pocketflow-tool-embeddings/
├── tools/
│   └── embeddings.py     # OpenAI embeddings API wrapper
├── utils/
│   └── call_llm.py      # Centralized OpenAI client configuration
├── nodes.py             # PocketFlow node implementation
├── flow.py             # Flow configuration
└── main.py             # Example usage
```

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key in one of two ways:
   
   a. Using a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   b. Or as a system environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load the OpenAI API key from environment
2. Create a PocketFlow node to handle embedding generation
3. Process a sample text and generate its embedding
4. Display the embedding dimension and first few values

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Secure API key handling
   - Flexible configuration options

2. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between tools and PocketFlow components
   - Reusable OpenAI client configuration
   - Modular project structure

3. **PocketFlow Integration**
   - Node implementation with prep->exec->post lifecycle
   - Flow configuration
   - Shared store usage for data passing

# PocketFlow Tracing with Langfuse

This cookbook provides comprehensive observability for PocketFlow workflows using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) as the tracing backend. With minimal code changes (just adding a decorator), you can automatically trace all node executions, inputs, outputs, and errors in your PocketFlow workflows.

## 🎯 Features

- **Automatic Tracing**: Trace entire flows with a single decorator
- **Node-Level Observability**: Automatically trace `prep`, `exec`, and `post` phases of each node
- **Input/Output Tracking**: Capture all data flowing through your workflow
- **Error Tracking**: Automatically capture and trace exceptions
- **Async Support**: Full support for AsyncFlow and AsyncNode
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Just add `@trace_flow()` to your flow classes
- **Langfuse Integration**: Leverage Langfuse's powerful observability platform

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your Langfuse credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your actual Langfuse configuration:

```env
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your-langfuse-secret-key
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-langfuse-public-key
LANGFUSE_HOST=your-langfuse-host-url
POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=true
```

**Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Langfuse credentials and host URL.

### 3. Basic Usage

```python
from pocketflow import Node, Flow
from tracing import trace_flow

class MyNode(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["input"]
    
    def exec(self, data):
        return f"Processed: {data}"
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        shared["output"] = exec_res
        return "default"

@trace_flow()  # 🎉 That's it! Your flow is now traced
class MyFlow(Flow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(start=MyNode())

# Run your flow - tracing happens automatically
flow = MyFlow()
shared = {"input": "Hello World"}
flow.run(shared)
```

## 📊 What Gets Traced

When you apply the `@trace_flow()` decorator, the system automatically traces:

### Flow Level
- **Flow Start/End**: Overall execution time and status
- **Input Data**: Initial shared state when flow starts
- **Output Data**: Final shared state when flow completes
- **Errors**: Any exceptions that occur during flow execution

### Node Level
For each node in your flow, the system traces:

- **prep() Phase**: 
  - Input: `shared` data
  - Output: `prep_res` returned by prep method
  - Execution time and any errors

- **exec() Phase**:
  - Input: `prep_res` from prep phase
  - Output: `exec_res` returned by exec method
  - Execution time and any errors
  - Retry attempts (if configured)

- **post() Phase**:
  - Input: `shared`, `prep_res`, `exec_res`
  - Output: Action string returned
  - Execution time and any errors

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

```python
from tracing import trace_flow, TracingConfig

# Use environment variables (default)
@trace_flow()
class MyFlow(Flow):
    pass

# Custom flow name
@trace_flow(flow_name="CustomFlowName")
class MyFlow(Flow):
    pass

# Custom session and user IDs
@trace_flow(session_id="session-123", user_id="user-456")
class MyFlow(Flow):
    pass
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from tracing import TracingConfig

# Create custom configuration
config = TracingConfig(
    langfuse_secret_key="your-secret-key",
    langfuse_public_key="your-public-key", 
    langfuse_host="https://your-langfuse-instance.com",
    debug=True,
    trace_inputs=True,
    trace_outputs=True,
    trace_errors=True
)

@trace_flow(config=config)
class MyFlow(Flow):
    pass
```

## 📁 Examples

### Basic Synchronous Flow
See `examples/basic_example.py` for a complete example of tracing a simple synchronous flow.

```bash
cd examples
python basic_example.py
```

### Asynchronous Flow
See `examples/async_example.py` for tracing AsyncFlow and AsyncNode.

```bash
cd examples  
python async_example.py
```

## 🔍 Viewing Traces

After running your traced flows, visit your Langfuse dashboard to view the traces:

**Dashboard URL**: Use the URL you configured in `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variable

In the dashboard you'll see:
- **Traces**: One trace per flow execution
- **Spans**: Individual node phases (prep, exec, post)
- **Input/Output Data**: All data flowing through your workflow
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times for each phase
- **Error Details**: Stack traces and error messages

The tracings in examples.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Tracer Configuration

```python
from tracing import TracingConfig, LangfuseTracer

# Create custom configuration
config = TracingConfig.from_env()
config.debug = True

# Use tracer directly (for advanced use cases)
tracer = LangfuseTracer(config)
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize tracing behavior with these environment variables:

```env
# Required Langfuse configuration
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
LANGFUSE_HOST=your-langfuse-host

# Optional tracing configuration
POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_INPUTS=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_OUTPUTS=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_PREP=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_EXEC=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_POST=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_ERRORS=true

# Optional session/user tracking
POCKETFLOW_SESSION_ID=your-session-id
POCKETFLOW_USER_ID=your-user-id
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"langfuse package not installed"**
   ```bash
   pip install langfuse
   ```

2. **"Langfuse client initialization failed"**
   - Check your `.env` file configuration
   - Verify Langfuse server is running at the specified host
   - Check network connectivity

3. **"No traces appearing in dashboard"**
   - Ensure `POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=true` to see debug output
   - Check that your flow is actually being executed
   - Verify Langfuse credentials are correct

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed tracing information:

```env
POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=true
```

This will print detailed information about:
- Langfuse client initialization
- Trace and span creation
- Data serialization
- Error messages

## 📚 API Reference

### `@trace_flow()`

Decorator to add Langfuse tracing to PocketFlow flows.

**Parameters:**
- `config` (TracingConfig, optional): Custom configuration. If None, loads from environment.
- `flow_name` (str, optional): Custom name for the flow. If None, uses class name.
- `session_id` (str, optional): Session ID for grouping related traces.
- `user_id` (str, optional): User ID for the trace.

### `TracingConfig`

Configuration class for tracing settings.

**Methods:**
- `TracingConfig.from_env()`: Create config from environment variables
- `validate()`: Check if configuration is valid
- `to_langfuse_kwargs()`: Convert to Langfuse client kwargs

### `LangfuseTracer`

Core tracer class for Langfuse integration.

**Methods:**
- `start_trace()`: Start a new trace
- `end_trace()`: End the current trace
- `start_node_span()`: Start a span for node execution
- `end_node_span()`: End a node execution span
- `flush()`: Flush pending traces to Langfuse

# PocketFlow Visualization

This directory contains tools for visualizing PocketFlow workflow graphs using interactive D3.js visualizations.

## Overview

The visualization tools allow you to:

1. View PocketFlow nodes and flows as an interactive graph
2. See how different flows connect to each other
3. Understand the relationships between nodes within flows

## Features

- **Interactive Graph**: Nodes can be dragged to reorganize the layout
- **Group Visualization**: Flows are displayed as groups with dashed borders
- **Inter-Group Links**: Connections between flows are shown as dashed lines connecting group boundaries
- **Action Labels**: Edge labels show the actions that trigger transitions between nodes

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for viewing the visualizations

## Usage

### 1. Basic Visualization

To visualize a PocketFlow graph, you can use the `visualize_flow` function in `visualize.py`:

```python
from visualize import visualize_flow
from your_flow_module import your_flow

# Generate visualization
visualize_flow(your_flow, "Your Flow Name")
```

This will:
1. Print a Mermaid diagram to the console
2. Generate a D3.js visualization in the `./viz` directory

### 2. Running the Example

The included example shows an order processing pipeline with payment, inventory, and shipping flows:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd cookbook/pocketflow-minimal-flow2flow

# Run the visualization script
python visualize.py
```

This will generate visualization files in the `./viz` directory.

### 3. Viewing the Visualization

After running the script:

1. Host with 
   ```
   cd ./viz/
   ```

2. Interact with the visualization:
   - **Drag nodes** to reorganize
   - **Hover over nodes** to see node names
   - **Observe connections** between nodes and flows

## Customizing the Visualization

### Adjusting Layout Parameters

You can adjust the force simulation parameters in `visualize.py` to change how nodes and groups are positioned:

```javascript
// Create a force simulation
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(data.nodes)
    // Controls the distance between connected nodes
    .force("link", d3.forceLink(data.links).id(d => d.id).distance(100))
    // Controls how nodes repel each other - lower values bring nodes closer
    .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody().strength(-30))
    // Centers the entire graph in the SVG
    .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2))
    // Prevents nodes from overlapping - acts like a minimum distance
    .force("collide", d3.forceCollide().radius(50));
```

### Styling

Adjust the CSS styles in the HTML template inside `create_d3_visualization` function to change colors, shapes, and other visual properties.

## How It Works

The visualization process consists of three main steps:

1. **Flow to JSON Conversion**: The `flow_to_json` function traverses the PocketFlow graph and converts it to a structure with nodes, links, and group information.

2. **D3.js Visualization**: The JSON data is used to create an interactive D3.js visualization with:
   - Nodes represented as circles
   - Flows represented as dashed rectangles containing nodes
   - Links showing connections within and between flows

3. **Group Boundary Connections**: The visualization calculates intersection points with group boundaries to ensure inter-group links connect at the borders rather than centers.

## Extending the Visualization

You can extend the visualization tools by:

1. Adding new node shapes
2. Implementing additional layout algorithms
3. Adding tooltips with more detailed information
4. Creating animation for flow execution

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Make sure your flow objects are properly constructed with nodes connected correctly
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify that the generated JSON data structure matches what you expect

## Example Output

The visualization displays:
- Payment processing flow nodes
- Inventory management flow nodes
- Shipping flow nodes
- Group boundaries around each flow
- Connections between flows (Payment → Inventory → Shipping)

# PocketFlow Voice Chat

This project demonstrates a voice-based interactive chat application built with PocketFlow. Users can speak their queries, and the system will respond with spoken answers from an LLM, maintaining conversation history.

- Check out the [Substack Post Tutorial](https://pocketflow.substack.com/p/build-your-own-voice-chatbot-from) for more!


## Features

-   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Automatically detects when the user starts and stops speaking.
-   **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts spoken audio into text using OpenAI.
-   **LLM Interaction**: Processes the transcribed text with an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o), maintaining conversation history.
-   **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the LLM's text response back into audible speech using OpenAI.
-   **Continuous Conversation**: Loops back to listen for the next user query after responding, allowing for an ongoing dialogue.

## How to Run

1.  **Set your OpenAI API key**:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    Ensure this environment variable is set, as the utility scripts for STT, LLM, and TTS rely on it.
    You can test individual utility functions (e.g., `python utils/call_llm.py`, `python utils/text_to_speech.py`) to help verify your API key and setup.

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install libraries such as `openai`, `pocketflow`, `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `soundfile`.

    **Note for Linux users**: `sounddevice` may require PortAudio. If you encounter issues, you might need to install it first:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    Follow the console prompts. The application will start listening when you see "Listening for your query...".

## How It Works

The application uses a PocketFlow workflow to manage the conversation steps:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CaptureAudio[Capture Audio] --> SpeechToText[Speech to Text]
    SpeechToText --> QueryLLM[Query LLM]
    QueryLLM --> TextToSpeech[Text to Speech & Play]
    TextToSpeech -- "Next Turn" --> CaptureAudio
```

Here's what each node in the flow does:

1.  **`CaptureAudioNode`**: Records audio from the user's microphone. It uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to start recording when speech is detected and stop when silence is detected.
2.  **`SpeechToTextNode`**: Takes the recorded audio data, converts it to a suitable format, and sends it to OpenAI's STT API (gpt-4o-transcribe) to get the transcribed text.
3.  **`QueryLLMNode`**: Takes the transcribed text from the user, along with the existing conversation history, and sends it to an LLM (OpenAI's GPT-4o model) to generate an intelligent response.
4.  **`TextToSpeechNode`**: Receives the text response from the LLM, converts it into audio using OpenAI's TTS API (gpt-4o-mini-tts), and plays the audio back to the user. If the conversation is set to continue, it transitions back to the `CaptureAudioNode`.

## Example Interaction

When you run `main.py`:

1.  The console will display:
    ```
    Starting PocketFlow Voice Chat...
    Speak your query after 'Listening for your query...' appears.
    ...
    ```
2.  When you see `Listening for your query...`, speak clearly into your microphone.
3.  After you stop speaking, the console will show updates:
    ```
    Audio captured (X.XXs), proceeding to STT.
    Converting speech to text...
    User: [Your transcribed query will appear here]
    Sending query to LLM...
    LLM: [The LLM's response text will appear here]
    Converting LLM response to speech...
    Playing LLM response...
    ```
4.  You will hear the LLM's response spoken aloud.
5.  The application will then loop back, and you'll see `Listening for your query...` again, ready for your next input.

The conversation continues in this manner. To stop the application, you typically need to interrupt it (e.g., Ctrl+C in the terminal), as it's designed to loop continuously.

# Design Doc: PocketFlow Voice Chat

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

-   **Goal**: Enable users to interact with an LLM via voice in a continuous conversation, receiving spoken responses.
-   **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to speak my query into a microphone so that the application can understand what I'm asking.
-   **User Story 2**: As a user, I want the application to send my spoken query to an LLM for processing.
-   **User Story 3**: As a user, I want to hear the LLM's response spoken back to me.
-   **User Story 4**: As a user, after hearing the response, I want the application to be ready for my next spoken query without restarting.
-   **Core Functionalities**:
    1.  Capture audio input.
    2.  Convert speech to text (STT).
    3.  Process text with an LLM (maintaining conversation history).
    4.  Convert LLM text response to speech (TTS).
    5.  Play back synthesized audio.
    6.  Loop back to capture new audio input for a continuous conversation.

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

-   **Workflow**: A sequential workflow with a loop is most appropriate. Each step (audio capture, STT, LLM query, TTS, audio playback) directly follows the previous, and after playback, the flow returns to the audio capture stage.

### Flow high-level Design:

The application will operate in a loop to allow for continuous conversation:
1.  **`CaptureAudioNode`**: Records audio from the user\'s microphone when triggered.
2.  **`SpeechToTextNode`**: Converts the recorded audio into text.
3.  **`QueryLLMNode`**: Sends the transcribed text (with history) to an LLM and gets a text response.
4.  **`TextToSpeechNode`**: Converts the LLM\'s text response into in-memory audio data and then plays it. After completion, the flow transitions back to the `CaptureAudioNode`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CaptureAudio[Capture Audio] --> SpeechToText[Speech to Text]
    SpeechToText --> QueryLLM[Query LLM]
    QueryLLM --> TextToSpeech[Text to Speech & Play]
    TextToSpeech -- "Next Turn" --> CaptureAudio
```

## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1.  **`record_audio()`** (`utils/audio_utils.py`)
    -   *Input*: (Optional) `sample_rate` (int, Hz, e.g., `DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE`), `channels` (int, e.g., `DEFAULT_CHANNELS`), `chunk_size_ms` (int, e.g., `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE_MS`), `silence_threshold_rms` (float, e.g., `DEFAULT_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_RMS`), `min_silence_duration_ms` (int, e.g., `DEFAULT_MIN_SILENCE_DURATION_MS`), `max_recording_duration_s` (int, e.g., `DEFAULT_MAX_RECORDING_DURATION_S`), `pre_roll_chunks_count` (int, e.g., `DEFAULT_PRE_ROLL_CHUNKS`).
    -   *Output*: A tuple `(audio_data, sample_rate)` where `audio_data` is a NumPy array of float32 audio samples, and `sample_rate` is the recording sample rate (int). Returns `(None, sample_rate)` if no speech is detected or recording fails.
    -   *Description*: Records audio from the microphone using silence-based Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Buffers `pre_roll_chunks_count` of audio and starts full recording when sound is detected above `silence_threshold_rms`. Stops after `min_silence_duration_ms` of sound below the threshold or if `max_recording_duration_s` is reached.
    -   *Necessity*: Used by `CaptureAudioNode` to get user\'s voice input.

2.  **`speech_to_text_api(audio_data, sample_rate)`** (`utils/speech_to_text.py`)
    -   *Input*: `audio_data` (bytes), `sample_rate` (int, though the API might infer this from the audio format).
    -   *Output*: `transcribed_text` (str).
    -   *Necessity*: Used by `SpeechToTextNode` to convert in-memory audio data to text.
    -   *Example Model*: OpenAI `gpt-4o-transcribe`.

3.  **`call_llm(messages)`** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
    -   *Input*: `messages` (list of dicts, e.g., `[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]`). This should be the complete conversation history including the latest user query.
    -   *Output*: `llm_response_text` (str)
    -   *Necessity*: Used by `QueryLLMNode` to get an intelligent response.
    -   *Example Model*: OpenAI `gpt-4o`.

4.  **`text_to_speech_api(text_to_synthesize)`** (`utils/text_to_speech.py`)
    -   *Input*: `text_to_synthesize` (str).
    -   *Output*: A tuple `(audio_data, sample_rate)` where `audio_data` is in-memory audio as bytes (e.g., MP3 format from OpenAI) and `sample_rate` is the audio sample rate (int, e.g., 24000 Hz for OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-tts`).
    -   *Necessity*: Used by `TextToSpeechNode` to convert LLM text to speakable in-memory audio data.
    -   *Example Model*: OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-tts`.

5.  **`play_audio_data(audio_data, sample_rate)`** (`utils/audio_utils.py`)
    -   *Input*: `audio_data` (NumPy array of float32 audio samples), `sample_rate` (int).
    -   *Output*: None
    -   *Necessity*: Used by `TextToSpeechNode` (in its `post` method) to play the in-memory synthesized speech.

## Node Design

### Shared Memory

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared memory structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "user_audio_data": None,      # In-memory audio data (NumPy array) from user
    "user_audio_sample_rate": None, # int: Sample rate of the user audio
    "chat_history": [],            # list: Conversation history [{"role": "user/assistant", "content": "..."}]
    "continue_conversation": True # boolean: Flag to control the main conversation loop
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1.  **`CaptureAudioNode`**
    -   *Purpose*: Record audio input from the user using VAD.
    -   *Type*: Regular
    -   *Steps*:
        -   *prep*: Check `shared["continue_conversation"]`. (Potentially load VAD parameters from `shared["config"]` if dynamic).
        -   *exec*: Call `utils.audio_utils.record_audio()` (passing VAD parameters if configured). This returns a NumPy array and sample rate.
        -   *post*: `audio_numpy_array, sample_rate = exec_res`. Write `audio_numpy_array` to `shared["user_audio_data"]` and `sample_rate` to `shared["user_audio_sample_rate"]`. Returns `"default"`.

2.  **`SpeechToTextNode`**
    -   *Purpose*: Convert the recorded in-memory audio to text.
    -   *Type*: Regular
    -   *Steps*:
        -   *prep*: Read `shared["user_audio_data"]` (NumPy array) and `shared["user_audio_sample_rate"]`. Return `(user_audio_data_numpy, user_audio_sample_rate)`.
        -   *exec*: `audio_numpy_array, sample_rate = prep_res`. **Convert `audio_numpy_array` to audio `bytes` (e.g., in WAV format using `scipy.io.wavfile.write` to an `io.BytesIO` object).** Call `utils.speech_to_text.speech_to_text_api(audio_bytes, sample_rate)`.
        -   *post*:
            -   Let `transcribed_text = exec_res`.
            -   Append `{"role": "user", "content": transcribed_text}` to `shared["chat_history"]`.
            -   Clear `shared["user_audio_data"]` and `shared["user_audio_sample_rate"]` as they are no longer needed.
            -   Returns `"default"` (assuming STT is successful as per simplification).

3.  **`QueryLLMNode`**
    -   *Purpose*: Get a response from the LLM based on the user's query and conversation history.
    -   *Type*: Regular
    -   *Steps*:
        -   *prep*: Read `shared["chat_history"]`. Return `chat_history`.
        -   *exec*: `history = prep_res`. Call `utils.call_llm.call_llm(messages=history)`.
        -   *post*:
            -   Let `llm_response = exec_res`.
            -   Append `{"role": "assistant", "content": llm_response}` to `shared["chat_history"]`.
            -   Returns `"default"` (assuming LLM call is successful).

4.  **`TextToSpeechNode`**
    -   *Purpose*: Convert the LLM's text response into speech and play it.
    -   *Type*: Regular
    -   *Steps*:
        -   *prep*: Read `shared["chat_history"]`. Identify the last message, which should be the LLM's response. Return its content.
        -   *exec*: `text_to_synthesize = prep_res`. Call `utils.text_to_speech.text_to_speech_api(text_to_synthesize)`. This returns `(llm_audio_bytes, llm_sample_rate)`.
        -   *post*: `llm_audio_bytes, llm_sample_rate = exec_res`.
            -   **Convert `llm_audio_bytes` (e.g., MP3 bytes from TTS API) to a NumPy array of audio samples (e.g., using a library like `pydub` or `soundfile` to decode).**
            -   Call `utils.audio_utils.play_audio_data(llm_audio_numpy_array, llm_sample_rate)`.
            -   (Optional) Log completion.
            -   If `shared["continue_conversation"]` is `True`, return `"next_turn"` to loop back.
            -   Otherwise, return `"end_conversation"`.

# Article Writing Workflow

A PocketFlow example that demonstrates an article writing workflow using a sequence of LLM calls.

## Features

- Generate a simple outline with up to 3 main sections using YAML structured output
- Write concise (100 words max) content for each section in simple terms
- Apply a conversational, engaging style to the final article

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Run the application with a default topic ("AI Safety"):

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Or specify your own topic:

```bash
python main.py Climate Change
```

## How It Works

The workflow consists of three sequential nodes:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Outline[Generate Outline] --> Write[Write Content]
    Write --> Style[Apply Style]
```

Here's what each node does:

1. **Generate Outline**: Creates a simple outline with up to 3 main sections using YAML structured output
2. **Write Simple Content**: Writes a concise 100-word explanation for each section
3. **Apply Style**: Rewrites the combined content in a conversational, engaging style

## Files

- [`main.py`](./main.py): Main entry point for running the article workflow
- [`flow.py`](./flow.py): Defines the flow that connects the nodes
- [`nodes.py`](./nodes.py): Contains the node classes for each step in the workflow
- [`utils/call_llm.py`](./utils/call_llm.py): LLM utility function
- [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt): Lists the required dependencies

## Example Output

===== SECTION CONTENTS =====

--- Introduction to AI Safety ---
AI Safety is about making sure that artificial intelligence (AI) systems are helpful and not harmful. Imagine teaching a robot to help with chores. AI Safety is like setting ground rules for the robot so it doesn't accidentally cause trouble, like mistaking a pet for a toy. By ensuring AI systems understand their tasks and limitations, we can trust them to act safely. It's about creating guidelines and checks to ensure AI assists us without unintended consequences.

--- Key Challenges in AI Safety ---
AI safety is about ensuring that artificial intelligence systems operate in ways that are beneficial and not harmful. One key challenge is making sure AI makes decisions that align with human values. Imagine teaching a robot to fetch coffee, but it ends up knocking things over because it doesn't understand the mess it creates. Similarly, if AI systems don't fully grasp human intentions, they might act in unexpected ways. The task is to make AI smart enough to achieve goals without causing problems, much like training a puppy to follow rules without chewing on your shoes.

--- Strategies for Ensuring AI Safety ---
Ensuring AI safety is about making sure artificial intelligence behaves as expected and doesn’t cause harm. Imagine AI as a new driver on the road; we need rules and safeguards to prevent accidents. By testing AI systems under different conditions, setting clear rules for their behavior, and keeping human oversight, we can manage risks. For instance, just as cars have brakes to ensure safety, AI systems need to have fail-safes. This helps in building trust and avoiding unexpected issues, keeping both humans and AI on the right track.

===== FINAL ARTICLE =====

# Welcome to the World of AI Safety

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have your very own robot helping you around the house? Sounds like a dream, right? But let’s hit pause for a moment. What if this robot mistook your fluffy cat for a toy? That’s exactly where AI Safety comes in. Think of AI Safety as setting some friendly ground rules for your household helper, ensuring that it knows the difference between doing chores and causing a bit of chaos. It’s all about making sure our AI allies play by the rules, making life easier without those pesky accidental hiccups.

# Navigating the Maze of AI Challenges

Picture this: you've asked your trusty robot to grab you a cup of coffee. But instead, it sends mugs flying and spills coffee because it doesn’t quite get the concept of a mess. Frustrating, isn’t it? One of the biggest hurdles in AI Safety is aligning AI decisions with our human values and intentions. It’s like training a puppy not to gnaw on your favorite pair of shoes. Our job is to teach AI how to reach its goals without stepping on our toes, all while being as reliable and lovable as a well-trained pup.

# Steering AI Toward Safe Horizons

Now, how do we keep our AI friends on the straight and narrow? Imagine AI as a new driver learning to navigate the roads of life. Just like we teach new drivers the rules of the road and equip cars with brakes for safety, we provide AI with guidelines and fail-safes to prevent any unintended mishaps. Testing AI systems in various scenarios and keeping a watchful human eye on them ensures they don’t veer off track. It’s all about building trust and creating a partnership where both humans and AI are cruising smoothly together.

# Wrapping It Up

At the end of the day, AI Safety is about creating a harmonious relationship between humans and machines, where we trust our metal companions to support us without the fear of unexpected surprises. By setting boundaries and ensuring understanding, we’re not just building smarter machines—we’re crafting a future where AI and humanity can thrive together. So, next time you’re imagining that helpful robot assistant, rest easy knowing that AI Safety is making sure it's ready to lend a hand without dropping the ball—or your coffee mug!
